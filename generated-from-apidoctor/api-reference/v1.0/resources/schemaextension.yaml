  heading: schemaExtension resource type (schema extensions)
  intro: |
    Schema extensions allow you to define a schema to extend and add strongly-typed custom data to a resource type. The custom data appears as a complex type on the extended resource. 
    Schema extensions are supported by the following resource types:
    
    * [contact](contact.md)
    * [device](device.md)
    * [event](event.md) on a user or Office 365 group calendar
    * [post](post.md) of an Office 365 group
    * [group](group.md)
    * [message](message.md) 
    * [organization](organization.md)
    * [user](user.md)
    
    See the [schema extension example](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md) to learn how to add custom data to groups.

    Here is a JSON representation of the resource.

    ```json
    {
      "description": "String",
      "id": "String (identifier)",
      "owner": "String",
      "properties": [{"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.extensionSchemaProperty"}],
      "status": "String",

properties:
  heading: Properties
  table:
  - name: description
    type: String
    description: Description for the schema extension.
  - name: id
    type: String
    description: The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. You can assign a value in one of two ways: Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, {domainName}_{schemaName}. As an example, contoso_mySchema. Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the id assignment in this format: ext{8-random-alphanumeric-chars}_{schema-name}. An example would be extkvbmkofy_mySchema.This property cannot be changed after creation.
  - name: owner
    type: String
    description: The appId of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.  If not supplied, then the calling application's appId will be set as the owner. In either case, the signed-in user must be the owner of the application. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
  - name: properties
    type: Collection(microsoft.graph.extensionSchemaProperty)
    description: The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.
  - name: status
    type: String
    description: The lifecycle state of the schema extension. Possible states are InDevelopment, Available, and Deprecated. Automatically set to InDevelopment on creation. Schema extensions provides more information on the possible state transitions and behaviors.
  - name: targetTypes
    type: Collection(String)
    description: Set of Microsoft Graph types (that can support extensions) that the schema extension can be applied to. Select from contact, device, event, group, message, organization, post, or user.
