summary:
  heading: "RemoteItem resource type"
  intro: |
    The **remoteItem** resource indicates that a [**driveItem**](xref:graph.driveitem) references an item that exists in another drive.
    This resource provides the unique IDs of the source drive and target item.
    [**DriveItems**](xref:graph.driveitem) with a non-null **remoteItem** facet are resources that are shared, added to the user's OneDrive, or on items returned from hetrogenous collections of items (like search results).
    **Note:** Unlike with folders in the same drive, a **driveItem** moved into a remote item may have its `id` value changed.
