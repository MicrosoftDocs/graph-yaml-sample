  heading: Working with Excel in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    You can use Microsoft Graph to allow web and mobile applications to read and modify Excel workbooks stored in OneDrive for Business, SharePoint site or Group drive. The `Workbook` (or Excel file) resource contains all the other Excel resources through relationships. You can access a workbook through the [Drive API](xref:graph.drive) by identifying the location of the file in the URL. For example:
    `https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/`  
    `https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/drive/root:/{item-path}:/workbook/`  
    You can access a set of Excel objects (such as Table, Range, or Chart) by using standard REST APIs to perform  create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the workbook. For example, 
    `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/worksheets`  
    returns a collection of worksheet objects that are part of the workbook.    
    The Excel REST API supports only Office Open XML file formatted workbooks. The `.xls` extension workbooks are not supported. 
    **Note**: Support for workbooks stored in OneDrive Consumer platform is still not available. At this time, only the files stored in business platform is supported by Excel REST APIs.

    ## Authorization and scopes
    You can use the [Azure AD v.2 endpoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/converged_auth) to authenticate Excel APIs. All APIs require the `Authorization: Bearer {access-token}` HTTP header. Â  
    One of the following [permission scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/permission_scopes) is required to use the Excel resource:
    
    * Files.Read (for read actions)
    * Files.ReadWrite (for read and write actions)
    
requestBody:
  heading: Request
  intro: |
    Pass a JSON object by setting the `persistchanges` value to `true` or `false`. 
    
    ```http
    POST /{version}/me/drive/items/01CYZLFJGUJ7JHBSZDFZFL25KSZGQTVAUN/workbook/createSession
    content-type: Application/Json 
    authorization: Bearer {access-token}
    
    { "persistChanges": true }
    ```
    
    When the value of `persistChanges` is set to `false`, a non-persistent session id is returned.

    ```http
    HTTP code: 201 Created
    content-type: application/json;odata.metadata 
    
    {
      "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/$metadata#microsoft.graph.sessionInfo",
      "id": "{session-id}",
      "persistChanges": true
    }
    ```

    #### Usage
    The session ID returned from the previous call is passed as a header on subsequent API requests in  
    `workbook-session-id` HTTP header. 
    
    ```http
    GET /{version}/me/drive/items/01CYZLFJGUJ7JHBSZDFZFL25KSZGQTVAUN/workbook/worksheets
    authorization: Bearer {access-token} 
    workbook-session-id: {session-id}
    ```

  intro: |
    The following request updates the selected range with the text of "Sample text". Note that Range has 200 cells, whereas the provided input only has 1 cell value.
    
    ```http

    {
      "values" : "Sample text"
    }
