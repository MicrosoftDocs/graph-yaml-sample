  heading: Working with education APIs in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    The education APIs in Microsoft Graph enhance Office 365 resources and data with information that is relevant for education scenarios, including schools, students, teachers, classes, and enrollments. This makes it easy for you to build solutions that integrate with educational resources.
    The education APIs include rostering resources and assignments resources that you can use to interact with the rostering services in Microsoft Teams. You can use these resources to manage a school roster.
