  heading: Working with users in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    You can use Microsoft Graph to build compelling app experiences based on users, their relationships with other users and groups, and their mail, calendar, and files.
    You can access [users](xref:graph.user) through Microsoft Graph in two ways:
    
    * By their ID, `/users/{id | userPrincipalName}` 
    * By using the `/me` alias for the signed-in user, which is the same as `/users/{signed-in user's id}`

    ## Authorization
    One of the following [permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/permission_scopes) is required to access user operations. The first three permissions can be granted to an app by a user. The rest can only be granted to an app by the administrator.
    
    * User.ReadBasic.All
    * User.Read
    * User.ReadWrite
    * User.Read.All
    * User.ReadWrite.All
