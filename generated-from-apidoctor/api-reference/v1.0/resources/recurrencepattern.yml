  heading: "recurrencePattern resource type"
  intro: |
    Describes the frequency by which a recurring [event](xref:graph.event) repeats. 
    You can specify the recurrence pattern of a recurring event in one of 6 ways depending on your scenario. For each pattern type, specify the amount of time between occurrences. The actual occurrences of the recurring event always follow this pattern falling within the date range that you specify for the event. A recurring event is always defined by its **recurrencePattern** (how frequently the event repeats), and its [recurrenceRange](xref:graph.recurrencerange) (over how long the event repeats).
    Use the **type** property to specify the different types of **recurrencePattern**, and the **interval** property to specify the time between occurrences, which can be in number of days, weeks, months, or years, depending on the **type**. Note which properties are required for each type, as described in the following table.
    
    |Type of recurrence pattern|Value of type property|Description|Example|Required properties
    |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
    |Daily|`daily`|Event repeats based on the number of days specified by **interval** between occurrences.|Repeat event every 3 days.|**type**, **interval**
    |Weekly|`weekly`|Event repeats on the same day or days of the week, based on the number of weeks between each set of occurrences.|Repeat event Monday and Tuesday of every other week.|**type**, **interval**, **daysOfWeek**, **firstDayOfWeek**
    |Absolute monthly|`absoluteMonthly`|Event repeats on the specified day of the month (e.g. the 15th), based on the number of months between occurrences.|Repeat event quarterly (every 3 months) on the 15th.|**type**, **interval**, **dayOfMonth**
    |Relative monthly|`relativeMonthly`|Event repeats on the specified day or days of the week, in the same relative position in the month, based on the number of months between occurrences.|Repeat event on the second Thursday or Friday every three months.|**type**, **interval**, **daysOfWeek**
    |Absolute yearly|`absoluteYearly`|Event repeats on the specified day and month, based on the number of years between occurrences.|Repeat event on the 15th of March every 3 years.|**type**, **interval**, **dayOfMonth**, **month**
    |Relative yearly|`relativeYearly`|Event repeats on the specified day or days of the week, in the same relative position in a specific month of the year, based on the number of years between occurrences.|Repeat event on the second Thursday or Friday of every November every 3 years.|**type**, **interval**, **daysOfWeek**, **month**
