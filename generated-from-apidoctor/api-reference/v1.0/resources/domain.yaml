  heading: domain resource type
  intro: |
    Represents a domain associated with the tenant.
    Use domain operations to associate domains to a tenant, verify domain ownership, and configure supported services.  Domain operations enable registrars to automate domain association for services such as Office 365. For example, as part of domain sign up, a registrar can enable a vanity domain for email, websites, authentication, etc.
    To associate a domain with a tenant:
    
    1. [Associate](../api/domain_post_domains.md) a domain with a tenant.
    1. [Retrieve](../api/domain_list_verificationdnsrecords.md) the domain verification records. Add the verification record details to the domain's zone file using the domain registrar or DNS server configuration.
    1. [Verify](../api/domain_verify.md) the ownership of the domain. This will verify the domain and set the *isVerified* property to *true*.
    1. [Indicate](../api/domain_update.md) the supported services you plan to use with the domain.
    1. [Configure](../api/domain_list_serviceconfigurationrecords.md) supported services by retrieving a list of records needed to enable services for the domain. Add the configuration record details to the domain's zone file using the domain registrar or DNS server configuration.

  heading: Relationships
  intro: |
    Relationships between a domain and other objects in the directory such as its verification records and service configuration records are exposed through navigation properties. You can read these relationships by targeting these navigation properties in your requests.
