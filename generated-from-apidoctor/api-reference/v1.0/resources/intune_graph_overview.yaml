  heading: Working with Intune in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    The Microsoft Graph API for Intune enables programmatic access to Intune information for your tenant; the API performs the same Intune operations as those available through the **Azure Portal**.  
    For mobile device management (MDM) scenarios, the Graph API for Intune supports standalone deployments; Intune [hybrid deployments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/mdm/understand/choose-between-standalone-intune-and-hybrid-mobile-device-management) are not supported.

    ## Using the Intune Graph API
    Intune provides data into the Microsoft Graph API in the same way as other cloud services do, with rich entity information and relationship navigation.  Use Microsoft Graph API to combine information from other services and Intune to build rich cross-service applications for IT professionals or end users.     
    Here is an example of how you can determine whether an application is installed on a user's device: 
    
    1. Get from Azure Active Directory a list of devices registered to a user: 
    1. https://graph.microsoft.com/users/{user}/ownedDevices 
    1. Then view the list of applications for your tenant: 
    1. https://graph.microsoft.com/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps  
    1. Take the ID from the application and determine the installation state for the application (and therefore user):
    1. https://graph.microsoft.com/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/{id}/deviceStatuses/
