    |Method|Return Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |[Get Range](../api/range_get.md)|[Range](range.md)|Read properties and relationships of range object.
    |[Update](../api/range_update.md)|[Range](range.md)|Update Range object.
    |[Boundingrect](../api/range_boundingrect.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets the smallest range object that encompasses the given ranges. For example, the GetBoundingRect of "B2:C5" and "D10:E15" is "B2:E16".
    |[Cell](../api/range_cell.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets the range object containing the single cell based on row and column numbers. The cell can be outside the bounds of its parent range, so long as it's stays within the worksheet grid. The returned cell is located relative to the top left cell of the range.
    |[Column](../api/range_column.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets a column contained in the range.
    |[Columnsafter](../api/workbookrange_columnsafter.md)|[workbookRangeView](workbookrangeview.md)|Gets a certain number of columns to the right of the given range.
    |[Columnsbefore](../api/workbookrange_columnsbefore.md)|[workbookRangeView](workbookrangeview.md)|Gets a certain number of columns to the left of the given range.
    |[Entirecolumn](../api/range_entirecolumn.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets an object that represents the entire column of the range.
    |[Entirerow](../api/range_entirerow.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets an object that represents the entire row of the range.

    |[Lastcell](../api/range_lastcell.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets the last cell within the range. For example, the last cell of "B2:D5" is "D5".
    |[Lastcolumn](../api/range_lastcolumn.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets the last column within the range. For example, the last column of "B2:D5" is "D2:D5".
    |[Lastrow](../api/range_lastrow.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets the last row within the range. For example, the last row of "B2:D5" is "B5:D5".
    |[Offsetrange](../api/range_offsetrange.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets an object which represents a range that's offset from the specified range. The dimension of the returned range will match this range. If the resulting range is forced outside the bounds of the worksheet grid, an exception will be thrown.
    |[Row](../api/range_row.md)|[Range](range.md)|Gets a row contained in the range.
    |[Rowsabove](../api/workbookrange_rowsabove.md)|[workbookRangeView](workbookrangeview.md)|Gets a certain number of rows above a given range.

    |[Resizedrange](../api/workbookrange_resizedrange.md)|[workbookRangeView](workbookrangeview.md)|Gets a range object similar to the current range object, but with its bottom-right corner expanded (or contracted) by some number of rows and columns.
