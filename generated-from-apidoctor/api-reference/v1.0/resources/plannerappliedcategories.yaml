  intro: |
    The **AppliedCategoriesCollection** resource represents the collection of categories (or labels) that have been applied to a task. It is part of the [plannerTask](plannertask.md) object.
    There can be up to 6 categories applied to a task. Category descriptions, e.g. `category1`, `category2` etc., are part of the [plan details](plannerplandetails.md) object. This is an open type.

  intro: |
    Properties of an Open Type can be defined by the client. In this case though, the client must provide `category1`, `category2`, `category3`, `category4`, `category5` and/or `category6` as properties with their values being the `true` boolean when the corresponding categories are applied on the task. Example is shown below. When they do not apply, properties are automatically removed by setting their values to the `false` boolean.
