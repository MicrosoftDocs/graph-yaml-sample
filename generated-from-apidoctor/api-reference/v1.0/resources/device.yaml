  intro: |
    Represents a device registered in the organization. Devices are created in the cloud using the Device Registration Service or by Intune. They're used by conditional access policies for multi-factor authentication. These devices can range from desktop and laptop machines to phones and tablets. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).
    This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
