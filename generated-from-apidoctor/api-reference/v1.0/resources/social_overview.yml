  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph provides access to useful people data.
    You can use the [person](xref:graph.person) resource and the People API to aggregate information
    about a person from across mail, contacts, and social networks. The results are ordered by their
    relevance based on multiple communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. The API
    lets you browse, sort, select, filter, or search for persons based on your criteria.
    For scenarios and examples, see [Get information about relevant people](../../../concepts/people_example.md).
    To use the API, see the following:
