    An event in a calendar.
    This resource supports:
    
    * Adding your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
    * Using [delta query](../../../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, 
    by providing a [delta](../api/event_delta.md) function.
