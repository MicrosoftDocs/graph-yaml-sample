    The **Image** resource groups image-related properties into a single structure.
    If a [**DriveItem**](driveitem.md) has a non-null **image** facet, the item represents a bitmap image.
    **Note:** If the service is unable to determine the width and height of the image, the **Image** resource may be empty.
