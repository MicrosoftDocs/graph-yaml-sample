summary:
  heading: "mailFolder resource type"
  intro: |
    A mail folder in a user's mailbox, such as Inbox and Drafts. Mail folders can contain messages, other Outlook items, and child mail folders.
    This resource supports using [delta query](xref:graph.delta_query_overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates,
    by providing a [delta](xref:graph.mailfolder_delta) function.
    **Well-known folder names**
    Outlook creates certain folders for users by default. Instead of using the corresponding folder **id** value, for convenience, you can use
    the well-known folder names from the table below when accessing these folders. For example, you can get the Drafts folder using its well-known name with the following query.
    
    ```http
    GET /me/mailFolders/drafts
    ```
    
    Well-known names work regardless of the locale of the user's mailbox, so the above query will always return the user's Drafts folder regardless of how it is named.
    |Well-known folder name|Description
    |:-|:-|
    |archive|The archive folder messages are sent to when using the One_Click Archive feature in Outlook clients that support it. **Note:** this is not the same as the Archive Mailbox feature of Exchange online.
    |clutter|The clutter folder low-priority messages are moved to when using the Clutter feature.
    |conflicts|The folder that contains conflicting items in the mailbox.
    |conversationhistory|The folder where Skype saves IM conversations (if Skype is configured to do so).

    |scheduled|The folder that contains messages that are scheduled to reappear in the inbox using the Schedule feature in Outlook for iOS.

    **Access item counts efficiently**
    The `TotalItemCount` and `UnreadItemCount` properties of a folder allow you to conveniently compute the number of read items in the folder.
    They let you avoid queries like the following that can incur significant latency:
    https://outlook.office.com/api/v1.0/me/folders/inbox/messages?$count=true&$filter=isread%20eq%20false

    Mail folders in Outlook can contain more than one type of items, for example, the Inbox can contain meeting request items which are distinct from mail items. `TotalItemCount` and `UnreadItemCount` include items in a mail folder irrespective of their item types.
