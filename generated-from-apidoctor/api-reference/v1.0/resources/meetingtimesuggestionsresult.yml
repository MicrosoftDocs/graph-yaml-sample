summary:
  heading: meetingTimeSuggestionsResult resource type
  intro: |
    A collection of meeting suggestions if there is any, or the reason if there isn't.
    The following are the possible reasons that [findMeetingTimes](xref:graph.user_findmeetingtimes) does not return any meeting suggestions.
    |**emptySuggestionsReason value**|**Reasons**
    |:-|:-|
    |attendeesUnavailable|All of the attendees' availability is known, but not enough attendees are available to reach the [meeting confidence](xref:graph.user_findmeetingtimes#the-confidence-of-a-meeting-suggestion) threshold, which is 50% by default, for any time period.
    |attendeesUnavailableOrUnknown|Some or all of the attendees have unknown availability, causing the meeting confidence to fall below the set threshold, which is 50% by default. Attendee availability can become unknown if the attendee is outside of the organization, or there is an error obtaining free/busy information.
    |locationsUnavailable|The **isRequired** property of the [locationConstraint](xref:graph.locationconstraint) parameter is specified as mandatory, and yet there are no locations available at the calculated time slots.
    |organizerUnavailable|The **isOrganizerOptional** parameter is false and yet the organizer is not available during the requested time window.
    |unknown|The reason for not returning any meeting suggestions is not known.
