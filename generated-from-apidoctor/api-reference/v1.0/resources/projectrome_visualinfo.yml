summary:
  heading: visualInfo resource type
  intro: |
    A complex type for representing the **visualElements** property in the [activity](xref:graph.projectrome_activity) object.
    Each user activity will be shown in Timeline as an Adaptive Card. App developers are encouraged to provide a custom Card which captures the essence of the activity which took place in your app. This is possible by providing a custom JSON card in the content property.
    In addition to visual metadata with an Adaptive Card, app can specify content metadata – data that be used to build inferences on the user’s activity in order to offer new activities for future re-engagement. This is possible by using the activity's contentInfo property to provide a JSON object which leverages schema.org properties to describe the content.
    If a custom card is not provided, a simple card will be generated using displayText and description properties. Custom cards are recommended to showcase the best content from within your app.
