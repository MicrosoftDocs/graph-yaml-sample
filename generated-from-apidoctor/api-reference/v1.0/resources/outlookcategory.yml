summary:
  heading: "outlookCategory resource type"
  intro: |
    Represents a category by which a user can group Outlook items such as messages and events. The user defines categories in a master list, and can apply one or more of these user-defined
    categories to an item. 
    Using the REST API, you can [create](xref:graph.outlookuser_post_mastercategories) and define categories in the master list of categories for a user. 
    You can also [get this master list of categories](xref:graph.outlookuser_list_mastercategories), [get a specific category](xref:graph.outlookcategory_get), 
    [update](xref:graph.outlookcategory_update) the color associated with a category, or [delete](xref:graph.outlookcategory_delete) a category. 
    You can apply a category to an item by assigning the **displayName** property of the category to the **categories** collection of the item.
    Resources that can be assigned categories include [contact](xref:graph.contact), [event](xref:graph.event), [message](xref:graph.message), and [post](xref:graph.post).   
    Each category is attributed by 2 properties: **displayName** and **color**. The **displayName** value must be unique in a user's master list. 
    The **color** however does not have to be unique; multiple categories in the master list can be mapped to the same color. You can map up 
    to 25 different colors to categories in a user's master list.
