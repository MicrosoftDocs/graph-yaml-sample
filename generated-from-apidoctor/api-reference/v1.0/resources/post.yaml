  intro: |
    Represents an individual Post item within a [conversationThread](conversationthread.md) entity.
    Even though you cannot explicitly create a post, doing any of the following would create a post:
    
    * [Reply to an existing post](../api/post_reply.md) 
    * [Reply to an existing thread](../api/conversationthread_reply.md) 
    * [Create a thread in a new conversation](../api/group_post_threads.md)
    * [Create a new conversation](../api/group_post_conversations.md)
    
    This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
