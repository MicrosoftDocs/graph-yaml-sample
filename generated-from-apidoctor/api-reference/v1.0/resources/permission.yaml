    The **Permission** resource provides information about a sharing permission granted for a [DriveItem](driveitem.md) resource.

    The permission resource uses _facets_ to provide information about the kind of permission represented by the resource.
    Permissions with a [**link**][SharingLink] facet represent sharing links created on the item. 
    Sharing links contain a unique token that provides access to the item for anyone with the link.
    Permissions with an [**invitation**][SharingInvitation] facet represent permissions added by inviting specific users or groups to have access to the file.

    ## Sharing links
    The most common type of permissions are sharing links.
    Sharing links provide a unique URL that includes both the resource being shared
    and an authentication token that provides access to the resource. Users don't
    need to sign-in to access the content shared with a sharing link. Users can
    share a link that gives read-only access to the content or writable access to
    the content.
