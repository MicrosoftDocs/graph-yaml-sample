  heading: "post resource type"
  intro: |
    Represents an individual Post item within a [conversationThread](xref:graph.conversationthread) entity.
    Even though you cannot explicitly create a post, doing any of the following would create a post:
    
    * [Reply to an existing post](xref:graph.post_reply) 
    * [Reply to an existing thread](xref:graph.conversationthread_reply) 
    * [Create a thread in a new conversation](xref:graph.group_post_threads)
    * [Create a new conversation](xref:graph.group_post_conversations)
    
    This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
