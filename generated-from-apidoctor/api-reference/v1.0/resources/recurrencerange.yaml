  heading: recurrenceRange resource type
  intro: |
    Describes a date range over which a recurring [event](event.md) repeats. 
    You can specify the date range for a recurring event in one of 3 ways depending on your scenario. While you must always specify a **startDate** value for the date range, you can specify a recurring event that ends by a specific date, or that doesn't end, or that ends after a specific number of occurrences. Note that the actual occurrences within the date range always follow the recurrence pattern that you specify for the recurring event. A recurring event is always defined by its [recurrencePattern](recurrencepattern.md) (how frequently the event repeats), and its **recurrenceRange** (for how long the event repeats).
    Use the **type** property to specify the different types of **recurrenceRange**. Note the required properties for each type, as described in the following table.
