summary:
  heading: "plannerPlan resource type"
  intro: |
    The **plannerPlan** resource represents a plan in Office 365. A plan can be owned by a [group](xref:graph.group) and contains a collection of [plannerTasks](xref:graph.plannerTask). It can also have a collection of [plannerBuckets](xref:graph.plannerBucket). Each plan object has a [details](xref:graph.plannerPlanDetails) object that can contain more information about the plan. For more information about the relationships between groups, plans, and tasks, see [Planner](xref:graph.planner_overview).
