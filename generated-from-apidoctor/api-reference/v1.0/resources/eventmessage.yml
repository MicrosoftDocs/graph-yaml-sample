summary:
  heading: "eventMessage resource type"
  intro: |
    A message that represents a meeting request, cancellation, or response (which can be one of the following: acceptance, tentative acceptance, or decline).
    The **eventMessage** entity is derived from [message](xref:graph.message). The **meetingMessageType** property identifies the type of the event message.
    When an organizer or app sends a meeting request, the meeting request arrives in an attendee's Inbox as an **eventMessage** instance with the **meetingMessageType** of **meetingRequest**. In addition, Outlook automatically creates an **event** instance in the attendee's calendar, with the **showAs** property as **tentative**. 
    To get the properties of the associated event in the attendee's mailbox, the app can use the **event** navigation property of the **eventMessage**, as shown in 
    this [get event message example](xref:graph.eventmessage_get#request-2). The app can also respond to the event on behalf of the attendee programmatically, by [accepting](xref:graph.event_accept), [tentatively accepting](xref:graph.event_tentativelyaccept), or [declining](xref:graph.event_decline) the event.
    Aside from a meeting request, an **eventMessage** instance can be found in an attendee's Inbox folder as the result of an event organizer cancelling a meeting, or in the organizer's Inbox as a result of an attendee responding to the meeting request. An app can act on event messages in the same way as on messages with minor differences.
