  intro: |
    A user in the system. This is an education-specific variant of the user with the same `id` that Microsoft Graph will return from the non-education-specific `/users` endpoint.
    This object provides a targeted subset of properties from the core [user](user.md) object and adds a set of education-specific properties such as `primaryRole`, student, and teacher data.
