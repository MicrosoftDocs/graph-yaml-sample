  intro: |
    While most lists created by users will have one of the values listed above, other values are possible as well.
    Your app should be prepared to handle any values that are not listed here.
    For developers familiar with SharePoint's CSOM APIs, the `template` value corresponds to the `SPListTemplateType` enumeration.
