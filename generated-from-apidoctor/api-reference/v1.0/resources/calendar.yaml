summary:
  intro: |
    A calendar which is a container for events. It can be a calendar for a [user](user.md), or the default calendar of an Office 365 [group](group.md).

    > **Note:** There are a few minor differences in the way you can interact with user calendars and group calendars:

    - You can organize only user calendars in a [calendarGroup](calendargroup.md).
    - Outlook automatically accepts all meeting requests on behalf of groups. You can [accept](../api/event_accept.md), [tentatively accept](../api/event_tentativelyaccept.md), or [decline](../api/event_decline.md)  meeting requests for user calendars only.
    - Outlook doesn't support reminders for group events. You can [snooze](../api/event_snoozereminder.md) or [dismiss](../api/event_dismissreminder.md) a [reminder](reminder.md) for user calendars only.
