  heading: "OneDrive usage reports"
  intro: |
    You can use the OneDrive usage reports to gain a high-level view of the value you are getting from OneDrive in terms of the total number of files and storage used across all the OneDrive accounts in your organization. You can then drill down to understand the trends of active OneDrive accounts, how many files users have interacted with, and how much storage is used. These reports can also give you the details per OneDrive account.
