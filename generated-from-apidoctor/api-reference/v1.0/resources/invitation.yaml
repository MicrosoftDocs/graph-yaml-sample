  intro: |
    Use the invitation manager to create an invite, in order to add an external user to the organization. 
    The invitation process uses the following flow:
    
    * An invitation is created
    * An invitation is sent to the invited user (containing an invitation link)
    * The invited user clicks on the invitation link, signs in and redeems the invitation and creation of the user entity representing the invited user completes
    * The user is redirected to a specific page after redemption completes
    
    Creating an invitation will return a redemption URL in the response (*inviteRedeemUrl*). The create invitation API can automatically send an email containing the redemption URL to the invited user, by setting the *sendInvitationMessage* to true. You can also customize the message that will be sent to the invited user. Instead, if you wish to send the redemption URL through some other means, you can set the *sendInvitationMessage* to false and use the redeem URL from the response to craft your own communication. Currently, there is no API to perform the redemption process. The invited user has to click on the *inviteRedeemUrl* link sent in the communication in the step above, and go through the interactive redemption process in a browser. Once completed, the invited user becomes an external user in the organization.
