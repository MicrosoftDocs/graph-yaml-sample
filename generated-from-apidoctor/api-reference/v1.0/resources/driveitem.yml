summary:
  heading: "DriveItem resource type"
  intro: |
    The **driveItem** resource represents a file, folder, or other item stored in a drive.
    All file system objects in OneDrive and SharePoint are returned as **driveItem** resources.
    There are two primary ways of addressing a **driveItem** resource:
    
    * By the **driveItem** unique identifier using `drive/items/{item-id}`
    * By file system path using `/drive/root:/path/to/file`
    
    **DriveItem** resources have facets modeled as properties that provide data about the driveItem's identities and capabilities.
    For example:
    
    * Folders have a [**folder facet**][folder]
    * Files have a [**file facet**][file].
    * Images have an [**image facet**][image] in addition to their file facet.
    * Images taken with a camera (photos) have a [**photo facet**][photo] that identifies the item as a photo and provides the properties of when the photo was taken and with what device.
    
    Items with the **folder** facet act as containers of items and therefore have a `children` reference pointing to a collection of **driveItems** under the folder.

  heading: "JSON representation"
  intro: |
    Here is a JSON representation of a **driveItem** resource.
    The **driveItem** resource is derived from [**baseItem**][baseItem] and inherits properties from that resource.

    **Note:** The eTag and cTag properties work differently on containers (folders).
    The cTag value is modified when content or metadata of any descendant of the folder is changed.
    The eTag value is only modified when the folder's properties are changed, except for properties that are derived from descendants (like **childCount** or **lastModifiedDateTime**).

    ## Instance Attributes
    Instance attributes are properties with special behaviors.
    These properties are temporary and either a) define behavior the service should perform or b) provide short-term property values, like a download URL for an item that expires.
    |Property name|Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-
    |@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior|string|The conflict resolution behavior for actions that create a new item. You can use the values *fail*, *replace*, or *rename*. The default for PUT is *replace*. An item will never be returned with this annotation. Write-only.
    |@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl|string|A URL that can be used to download this file's content. Authentication is not required with this URL. Read-only.
    |@microsoft.graph.sourceUrl|string|When issuing a PUT request, this instance annotation can be used to instruct the service to download the contents of the URL, and store it as the file. Write-only.
    **Note:** The @microsoft.graph.downloadUrl value is a short-lived URL and can't be cached.
    The URL will only be available for a short period of time (1 hour) before it is invalidated.
remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    In OneDrive for Business or SharePoint document libraries, the **cTag** property is not returned, if the **driveItem** has a [folder][] facet.
