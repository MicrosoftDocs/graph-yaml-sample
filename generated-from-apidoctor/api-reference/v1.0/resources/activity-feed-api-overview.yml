summary:
  heading: "Use the activity feed REST API"
  intro: |
    You can use the activity feed API in Microsoft Graph to resume a user's actiity across devices and platforms. Activity feed API requests are performed on behalf of a user via [delegated permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md#delegated-permissions-application-permissions-and-effective-permissions) and the [user activity permission](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md), which can be used with either personal or work and school accounts. 
    User activities are represented by the [activity](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/projectrome_activity) resource and are organized in a time-based feed represented by the collection me/activities.

    ## What makes a great user activity?
    User activities don’t just launch apps — they are deep links into specific content within your app. The user activities you create can not only be used in your own app, but will also appear in Cortana and Windows Timeline — driving more app reengagement and making it easier for your users to continue using your app across multiple devices.
