summary:
  heading: Company terms and conditions in Microsoft Intune
  intro: |
    You can deploy Intune terms and conditions to user groups to explain how enrollment, access to work resources, and the Company Portal app affect devices and users. Users must accept the terms and conditions before they can use the Company Portal to enroll and access their work.
    You can create and deploy multiple policies containing different terms and conditions. You can also produce versions of the same terms and conditions in different languages and then deploy these to their appropriate groups.
