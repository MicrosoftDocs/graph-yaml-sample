  intro: |
    A rule that applies to messages in the Inbox of a user.
    In Outlook, you can set up rules for incoming messages in the Inbox to carry out specific actions upon certain conditions. 
    Programmatically, you can access rules through the **messageRules** navigation property of the Inbox [folder](mailfolder.md). 
    Each rule is represented by this **messageRule** resource, available rule actions are represented by the [messageRuleActions](messageruleactions.md) complex type, 
    and available rule conditions and exceptions are represented by the [messageRulePredicates](messagerulepredicates.md) complex type.
