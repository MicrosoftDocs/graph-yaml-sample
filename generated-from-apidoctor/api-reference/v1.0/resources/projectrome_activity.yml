summary:
  heading: "activity resource type"
  intro: |
    Represents a single activity within an app - for example, a TV show, a document, or a current campaign in a video game. When a user engages with that activity, the engagement is captured as a [history item](xref:graph.projectrome_historyitem) that indicates the start and end time for that activity. As the user re-engages with that activity over time, multiple history items are recorded for a single user activity.
    You can use activities in Microsoft Graph to enable users to get back to what they were doing in their app, across multiple devices. Activities that your app creates appear on all users' devices, and are exposed to users as deep links to specific content within your app. You can express specific content within your app as a destination that is showcased in Windows, and accessible on iOS and Android devices through Cortana notifications.
    Because every app is different, it's up to you to understand the best way to map actions within your application to user activities that will appear in Cortana and Timeline. For example, games might create an activity for each campaign, document authoring apps might create an activity for each unique document, and line-of-business apps might create an activity for each workflow.
    Your user activities will be showcased in Cortana and Windows Timeline user experiences, which are focused on increasing users' productivity and efficiency by helping them get back to content they worked on in the past.
