  heading: Use the OneNote REST API
  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph lets your app get authorized access to a user's OneNote notebooks, sections, and pages in a personal or organization account. With the [appropriate delegated or application permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md#notes-permissions), your app can access the OneNote data of the signed-in user or any user in a tenant.

    ## Root URL
    The OneNote service root URL uses the following format for all calls to the OneNote API.
    https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{location}/onenote/ 

    The `version` segment in the URL represents the version of Microsoft Graph that you want to use:
    
    * `v1.0` is for stable production code.
    * `beta` is to try out a feature that's in development. Features and functionality in the beta endpoint might change; we don't recommend that you use it in your production code.
    
    The location can be user notebooks on Office 365 or consumer OneDrive, group notebooks, or SharePoint site-hosted team notebooks on Office 365.
