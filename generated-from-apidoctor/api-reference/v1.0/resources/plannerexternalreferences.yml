  heading: Properties
  intro: |
    Properties of an Open Type can be defined by the client. In this case, the client must provide **valid URLs** based on the **HTTP/HTTPS** protocols as properties and their values must be the [externalReference](xref:graph.plannerexternalreference) objects. Based on OData, property names in Open Types cannot contain the following characters: `.`, `:`, `%`  so they need to be encoded. Example is shown below. To remove a reference, set the value of the property to `null`.
