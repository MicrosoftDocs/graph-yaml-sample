summary:
  heading: daylightTimeZoneOffset resource type
  intro: |
    Specifies when a time zone switches from standard time to daylight saving time.
    For example, if a time zone is specified with the following properties:
    
    * **bias** is 300
    * **daylightBias** is -100
    * **dayOccurrence** is 4
    * **dayOfWeek** is "sunday"
    * **month** is 5
    * **time** is 02:00:00
    _ **year** is 0
    That means the time during daylight saving time is +300-100=200 minutes ahead of UTC. The time zone transition from 
    daylight saving time to standard occurs at 2 AM on the fourth Sunday of May, every year.
