  heading: Remarks
  intro: |
    To address a **driveItem** from an **itemReference** resource, construct a URL of the format:
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{driveId}/items/{id}

    The **path** value is an API path relative to the target drive, for example: `/drive/root:/Documents/myfile.docx`.
    To retrieve the human-readable path for a breadcrumb, you can safely ignore everything up to the first `:` in the path string.
