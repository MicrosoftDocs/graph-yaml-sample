summary:
  heading: "Use the Planner REST API"
  intro: |
    You can use the Planner API in Microsoft Graph to create tasks and assign them to users in a group in Office 365.
    Before you get started with Planner API, it is worth understanding how the main objects relate to each other as well as to Office 365 groups.
  outro: |
    ## Groups
    Office 365 groups are the owners of the plans in the Planner API.
    To [get the plans owned by a group](xref:graph.plannergroup_list_plans), make the following HTTP request.
    GET /groups/{id}/planner/plans

    When [creating a new plan](xref:graph.planner_post_plans), make a group its owner by setting the `owner` property on a plan object. Plans must be owned by groups.
