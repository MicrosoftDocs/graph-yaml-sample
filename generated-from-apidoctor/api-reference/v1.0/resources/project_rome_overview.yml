  heading: Use the Microsoft Graph API to work with Project Rome
  intro: |
    [Project Rome](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome) is a Microsoft initiative to build a cross-device experiences platform. Project Rome enables an app on a local client or service to interact with apps and services on a remote host when the user signs in with the same Microsoft account that they use to sign in on the client device. This allows you to program cross-device and cross-platform experiences that are centered around user tasks rather than devices.
    A key component is exposed via Microsoft Graph to enable these experiences: activities.

    ## Activities
    Activities in Microsoft Graph enable you to drive user engagement with your apps across devices and platforms. An activity is the unit of user engagement, and consists of three components:
    
    * A deep link
    * A visual representation
    * Content metadata that describes the activity, using the [http://schema.org/](http://schema.org/) shared vocabulary
    
    When a session is created by an application, a history item is added to the activity to reflect the period of user engagement. Each time a user reengages with an activity, a new history item is added to the activity to accrue user engagement.
    When an application publishes user activity objects, the object will show up in some of the new UI surfaces in Windows; for example, Cortana Notifications and Timeline. You can specify both rich metadata (to allow activities to be presented in just the right context) and rich visuals (using [Adaptive Card](http://adaptivecards.io/) markup) in your activity objects.
    You can use the following Microsoft Graph APIs to create and retrieve user activities:
    
    * [Create or replace activity](xref:graph.projectrome_put_activity)
    * [Get activities](xref:graph.projectrome_get_activities)
    * [Get recent activities](xref:graph.projectrome_get_recent_activities)
    * [Delete an activity](xref:graph.projectrome_delete_activity)
    * [Create or replace a history item](xref:graph.projectrome_put_historyitem)
    * [Delete a history item](xref:graph.projectrome_delete_historyitem)
