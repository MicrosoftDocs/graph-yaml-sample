summary:
  heading: OneNoteResource resource type
  intro: |
    An image or other file resource on a OneNote page. 
    You can get the binary data of a resource, but getting a JSON representation of a resource object or a resource collection is not supported.
    
    ```json
    {
      "content": { "@odata.type": "Edm.Stream" },
      "contentUrl": "string (url)"
    }
    ```
    
    Get the binary data of a specific resource by sending a GET request to the resource's `content` endpoint:
    GET ../onenote/resources/{id}/content

    The file's resource URI is returned when you get a page's HTML content using the following request:
    GET ../onenote/pages/{id}/content

    In the page HTML, an `img` tag includes endpoints for the original image resource in the `data-fullres-src` attribute and the optimized image in the `src` attribute:
    <img 
        src="image-resource-url"  
        data-src-type="media-type"
        data-fullres-src="image-resource-url"  
        data-fullres-src-type="media-type" ... />

    An `object` tag (which represents files such as PDF, DOCX, and PNG) includes the endpoint for the file resource in the `data` attribute:
    <object
        data="file-resource-url"
        data-attachment="file-name.file-type" 
        type="media-type" ... />
