  heading: historyItem resource type
  intro: |
    Represents a history item for an [activity](projectrome_activity.md) in an app. User activities represent a single destination within your app - for example, a TV show, a document, or a current campaign in a video game. When a user engages with that activity, the engagement is captured as a history item that indicates the start and end time for that activity. As the user re-engages with that activity over time, multiple history items are recorded for a single user activity.
    When an app creates a session, a **historyItem** object should be added to the **activity** object to reflect the period of user engagement. Each time a user re-engages with an activity, a new **historyItem** is added to the activity to accrue user engagement.
