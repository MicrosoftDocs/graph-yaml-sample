    Specifies when a time zone switches from daylight saving time to standard time.
    For example, if a time zone is specified with the following properties:
    
    * **dayOccurrence** is 3
    * **dayOfWeek** is "Sunday"
    * **month** is 10
    * **time** is 02:00:00
    _ **year** is 0
    That means the transition from daylight saving time to standard occurs at 2 AM on the third Sunday of October, every year.
