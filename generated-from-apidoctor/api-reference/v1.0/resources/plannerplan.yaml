  intro: |
    The **plannerPlan** resource represents a plan in Office 365. A plan can be owned by a [group](group.md) and contains a collection of [plannerTasks](plannerTask.md). It can also have a collection of [plannerBuckets](plannerBucket.md). Each plan object has a [details](plannerPlanDetails.md) object that can contain more information about the plan. For more information about the relationships between groups, plans, and tasks, see [Planner](planner_overview.md).
