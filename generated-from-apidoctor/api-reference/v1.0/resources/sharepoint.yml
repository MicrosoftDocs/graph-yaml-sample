  heading: Working with SharePoint sites in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    The SharePoint API in Microsoft Graph supports the following core scenarios:
    
    * Access to SharePoint **sites**, **lists**, and **drives** (document libraries)
    * Read-only support for **site** resources (no ability to create new sites)
    * Read-write support for **lists**, **listItems**, and **driveItems**
    * Address resources by SharePoint ID, URL, or relative path
    
    The SharePoint API exposes three major resource types:
    
    * [Site](xref:graph.site) _(top-level object)_
    * [List](xref:graph.list)
    * [ListItem](xref:graph.listitem)
    
    The following is an example of a listItem resource.
    {
      "fields": {
        "Title": "Access card",
        "Employee": "Ryan Gregg",
        "EmployeeId": "10",
        "CardSerial": "01235492",
        "Alias": "RGregg",
        "ID": 1,
        "ContentType": "Item",
        "Modified": "2016-09-19T23:15:25-07:00",
        "Created": "2016-09-19T23:15:25-07:00"
      },
      "createdBy": {
        "user": {
          "id": "b757fdcb-0271-4807-b243-504139e4ba04",
          "displayName": "Ryan Gregg"
        }
      },
      "createdDateTime": "2016-09-20T06:15:25Z",
      "eTag": "48e941c3-9515-4c48-9760-c07c90c79d48,1",
      "id": "4",
      "lastModifiedBy": {
        "user": {
          "id": "b757fdcb-0271-4807-b243-504139e4ba04",
          "displayName": "Ryan Gregg"
        }
      },
      "lastModifiedDateTime": "2016-09-20T06:15:25Z",
    }

    Resources expose data in three different ways:
    
    * _Properties_ (like **id** and **name**) expose simple values.
    * _Facets_ (like **fields** and **createdBy**) expose complex values.
    * _References_ (like **items**) point to collections of other resources.
    
    You can expand references in your URL with the _expand_ query parameter; for example, `?expand=fields`.
    You can request specific properties and facets with the _select_ query parameter; for example, `?select=id,name`.
    By default, most properties and facets are returned while all references are hidden.
    For efficiency, we recommend that you specify _select_ and _expand_ to only return the data you care about.

    ## SharePoint API root resources
    The following examples are relative to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`.
    |Path|Description
    |:-|:-
    |/sites/root|Organization's default [site][].
    |/sites/{site-id}|Access a specific [site][] by its ID.
    |/sites/{site-id}/drive|Access the default [drive](xref:graph.drive) (document library) for the given [site][].
    |/sites/{site-id}/drives|Enumerate the [drives](xref:graph.drive) (document libraries) under the [site][].
    |/sites/{site-id}/sites|Enumerate the sub-sites under the [site][].
    |/sites/{site-id}/lists|Enumerate the [lists](xref:graph.list) under the [site](xref:graph.site).
    |/sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items|Enumerate the [listItems](xref:graph.listitem) under the [list](xref:graph.list).
    |/groups/{group-id}/sites/root|Access a group's team [site][].
    Sites can also be addressed by path by using the SharePoint hostname, followed by a colon and the relative path to the site.
    You can optionally transition back to addressing the resource model by putting another colon at the end.
    |Path|Description
    |:-|:-
    |/sites/contoso.sharepoint.com:/teams/hr|The site associated with https://contoso.sharepoint.com/teams/hr
    |/sites/contoso.sharepoint.com:/teams/hr:/drive|Access the default [drive](xref:graph.drive) for this site.
