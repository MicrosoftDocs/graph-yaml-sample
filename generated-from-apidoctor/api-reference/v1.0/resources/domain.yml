summary:
  heading: domain resource type
  intro: |
    Represents a domain associated with the tenant.
    Use domain operations to associate domains to a tenant, verify domain ownership, and configure supported services.  Domain operations enable registrars to automate domain association for services such as Office 365. For example, as part of domain sign up, a registrar can enable a vanity domain for email, websites, authentication, etc.
    To associate a domain with a tenant:
    
    1. [Associate](xref:graph.domain_post_domains) a domain with a tenant.
    1. [Retrieve](xref:graph.domain_list_verificationdnsrecords) the domain verification records. Add the verification record details to the domain's zone file using the domain registrar or DNS server configuration.
    1. [Verify](xref:graph.domain_verify) the ownership of the domain. This will verify the domain and set the *isVerified* property to *true*.
    1. [Indicate](xref:graph.domain_update) the supported services you plan to use with the domain.
    1. [Configure](xref:graph.domain_list_serviceconfigurationrecords) supported services by retrieving a list of records needed to enable services for the domain. Add the configuration record details to the domain's zone file using the domain registrar or DNS server configuration.
