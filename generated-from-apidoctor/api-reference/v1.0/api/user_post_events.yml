summary:
  heading: Create Event
  intro: |
    Create an [event](xref:graph.event) in the user's default calendar or specified calendar.
    You can specify the time zone for each of the start and end times of the event as part of these values, as the 
    **start** and **end** properties are of [dateTimeTimeZone](xref:graph.datetimetimezone) type. 
    When an event is sent, the server sends invitations to all the attendees.
    **Setting the location in an event**
    An Exchange administrator can set up a mailbox and an email address for a resource such as a meeting room, or equipment 
    like a projector. Users can then invite the resource as an attendee to a meeting. On behalf of the resource, the server accepts or rejects 
    the meeting request based on the free/busy schedule of the resource. 
    If the server accepts a meeting for the resource, it creates an event for the meeting in the resource's calendar. If the meeting is rescheduled, 
    the server automatically updates the event in the resource's calendar.
    Another advantage of setting up a mailbox for a resource is to control scheduling of the resource, for example, only executives
    or their delegates can book a private meeting room.
    If you're organizing an event that involves a meeting location:
    
    1. Set the **location** property of the **event** accordingly. 
    1. Set the optional **locationEmailAddress** property if the meeting location has an email address.
    
    Additionally, if the meeting location has been set up as a resource, or if the event involves some equipment that has been set up as a resource:
    
    1. Invite the resource as an [attendee](xref:graph.attendee).
    1. Set the attendee **type** property as `resource`.
    1. Set the attendee **emailAddress** as the resource email address.
