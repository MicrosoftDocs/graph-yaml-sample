requestBody:
  heading: "Request body"
  intro: |
    In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.
    |Property|Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |attendees|[Attendee](xref:graph.attendee)|The collection of attendees for the event.
    |body|[ItemBody](xref:graph.itembody)|The body of the message associated with the event.
    |categories|String|The categories associated with the event.
    |end|[DateTimeTimeZone](xref:graph.datetimetimezone)|The date and time that the event ends.<br/><br/>By default, the end time is in UTC. You can specify an optional time zone in EndTimeZone, express the end time in that time zone, and include a time offset from UTC. Note that if you use EndTimeZone, you must specify a value for StartTimeZone as well.<br/><br/>This example specifies February 25, 2015, 9:34pm in Pacific Standard Time: "2015-02-25T21:34:00-08:00".
    |importance|String|The importance of the event. The possible values are: `low`, `normal`, `high`.
    |isAllDay|Boolean|Set to true if the event lasts all day.
    |isReminderOn|Boolean|Set to true if an alert is set to remind the user of the event.
    |location|[Location](xref:graph.location)|The location of the event.
    |locations|[location](xref:graph.location) collection|The locations where the event is held or attended from. The **location** and **locations** properties always correspond with each other. If you update the **location** property, any prior locations in the **locations** collection would be removed and replaced by the new **location** value.
    |recurrence|[PatternedRecurrence](xref:graph.patternedrecurrence)|The recurrence pattern for the event.
    |reminderMinutesBeforeStart|Int32|The number of minutes before the event start time that the reminder alert occurs.
    |responseRequested|Boolean|Set to true if the sender would like a response when the event is accepted or declined.
    |sensitivity|String|The possible values are: `normal`, `personal`, `private`, `confidential`.
    |showAs|String|The status to show. The possible values are: `free`, `tentative`, `busy`, `oof`, `workingElsewhere`, `unknown`.
    |start|[DateTimeTimeZone](xref:graph.datetimetimezone)|The start time of the event. <br/><br/>By default, the start time is in UTC. You can specify an optional time zone in StartTimeZone, express the start time in that time zone, and include a time offset from UTC. Note that if you use StartTimeZone, you must specify a value for EndTimeZone as well.<br/><br/>This example specifies February 25, 2015, 7:34pm in Pacific Standard Time: "2015-02-25T19:34:00-08:00".
    |subject|String|The text of the event's subject line.
    Because the **event** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
    add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **event** instance.  
    If the **event** you're updating is the master event of a recurring series, contains multiple attendees, and has instances that have been updated separately, multiple notification emails will be sent out: one for the master series and one per instance that has been updated.
