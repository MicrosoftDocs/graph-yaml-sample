summary:
  heading: "Get recent user activities"
  intro: |
    Get recent activities for a given user. This OData function has some default behaviors included to make it operate like a "most recently used" API. The service will query for the most recent [historyItems](xref:graph.projectrome_historyitem), and then pull those related activities. Activities will be sorted according to the most recent **lastModified** on the **historyItem**. This means that activities without **historyItems** will not be included in the response. The UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp permission will also apply extra filtering to the response, so that only activities created by your application are returned. This server-side filtering might result in empty pages if the user is particularly active and other applications have created more recent activities. To get your application's activities, use the **nextLink** property to paginate.

queryParameters:
  heading: "Optional query parameters"
  intro: |
    This method supports some [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response. The following query parameters are supported:
    
    * $expand for the **historyItems** navigation property.
    * $top to limit the maximum number of items across pages.
    * $filter on the **lastModifiedDateTime** property for either **activities** or **historyItems**, if expanded.
    
    The following are some examples of supported queries with URL encoding.
    /me/activities/recent?$expand=historyItems($filter=lastModifiedDateTime%20gt%202018-01-22T21:45:00.347Z%20and%20lastModifiedDateTime%20lt%202018-01-22T22:00:00.347Z)
