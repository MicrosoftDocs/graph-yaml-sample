summary:
  heading: List thumbnails for a DriveItem
  intro: |
    Retrieve a collection of [ThumbnailSet](xref:graph.thumbnailset) resources for a [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resource.
    A DriveItem can be represented by zero or more [ThumbnailSet](xref:graph.thumbnailset) resources.
    Each **thumbnailSet** can have one or more [**thumbnail**](xref:graph.thumbnail) objects, which are images that represent the item.
    For example, a **thumbnailSet** may include **thumbnail** objects, such as common ones including `small`, `medium`, or `large`.
    There are many ways to work with thumbnails on OneDrive.
    Here are the most common ones:
    
    * Enumerate available thumbnails for an item
    * Retrieve a single thumbnail for an item
    * Retrieve thumbnail content
    * Retrieve thumbnails for multiple items in a single request
    * Retrieve custom thumbnail sizes
    * Upload a custom thumbnail for an item
    * Determine if a custom uploaded thumbnail exists

    ## Retrieve thumbnail binary content
    You can directly retrieve the content of the thumbnail by requesting the **content** property of the thumbnail.
    
    ```http
    GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/thumbnails/{thumb-id}/{size}/content
    ```

        heading: Example
        intro: |
          Here is an example of the request which retrieves available thumbnails for an item in the current user's OneDrive.
          This returns an array of available **thumbnailSets** for the item. 
          Any item in a drive can have zero or more thumbnails.
          **Note:** You can use the _select_ query string parameter to control which thumbnail sizes are returned in the **ThumbnailSet**.
          For example, `/thumbnails?select=medium` retrieves only the medium sized thumbnails.

              ## Get a single thumbnail
              Retrieve the metadata for a single thumbnail and size by addressing it directly in a request.
              
              ```http
              GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/thumbnails/{thumb-id}/{size}
              ```

        heading: Examples of custom identifiers
        intro: |
          |Thumbnail identifier|Resolution|Aspect ratio|Description
          |:-|:-|:-|:-|
          |c300x400|Bounded by 300x400 box|Original|Generate a thumbnail that fits inside a 300x400 pixel box, maintaining aspect ratio
          |c300x400_Crop|300x400|Cropped|Generate a thumbnail that is 300x400 pixels. This works by resizing the image to fill the 300x400 box and cropping whatever spills outside the box.
          **Note:** The thumbnail returned may not exactly match the pixel dimensions that was requested, but will match the aspect ratio.
          In some cases, a larger thumbnail may be returned than was requested, if the thumbnail already exists and can easily be scaled to match the requested resolution.
remarks:
  heading: Remarks
  intro: |
    **Note** In OneDrive for Business and SharePoint:
    Using these calls to expand the thumbnails collection will not work:
    
    * `GET /drive/root:/{item-path}?expand=children(expand=thumbnails)`
    * `GET /drive/items/{item-id}/children?expand=thumbnails`
    
    Thumbnails are not supported on SharePoint Server 2016.
