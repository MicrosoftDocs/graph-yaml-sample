summary:
  heading: "List thumbnails for a DriveItem"
  intro: |
    Retrieve a collection of [ThumbnailSet](xref:graph.thumbnailset) resources for a [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resource.
    A DriveItem can be represented by zero or more [ThumbnailSet](xref:graph.thumbnailset) resources.
    Each **thumbnailSet** can have one or more [**thumbnail**](xref:graph.thumbnail) objects, which are images that represent the item.
    For example, a **thumbnailSet** may include **thumbnail** objects, such as common ones including `small`, `medium`, or `large`.
    There are many ways to work with thumbnails on OneDrive.
    Here are the most common ones:
    
    * Enumerate available thumbnails for an item
    * Retrieve a single thumbnail for an item
    * Retrieve thumbnail content
    * Retrieve thumbnails for multiple items in a single request
    * Retrieve custom thumbnail sizes
    * Upload a custom thumbnail for an item
    * Determine if a custom uploaded thumbnail exists
