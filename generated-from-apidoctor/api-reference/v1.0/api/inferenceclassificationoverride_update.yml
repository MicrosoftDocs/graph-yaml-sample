summary:
  heading: "Update inferenceclassificationoverride"
  intro: |
    Change the **classifyAs** field of an override as specified. 
    You cannot use PATCH to change any other fields in an [inferenceClassificationOverride](xref:graph.inferenceClassificationOverride) instance. 
    If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her display name, you can use [POST](xref:graph.inferenceclassification_post_overrides) to force an update to the name field in the existing override.
    If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her SMTP address, [deleting](xref:graph.inferenceclassificationoverride_delete) the existing override and [creating](xref:graph.inferenceclassification_post_overrides) a new one with 
    the new SMTP address is the only way to "update" the override for this sender.
