    response:
      heading: "Response"
      intro: |
        Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the file.
        This is the same URL available through the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property on the DriveItem.
        To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
        Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immediately.
        Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
        ```

        ## Partial range downloads
        To download a partial range of bytes from the file, your app can use the `Range` header as specified in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). 
        Note that you must append the `Range` header to the actual `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` URL and not to the request for `/content`.
        
        ```http
        GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
        Range: bytes=0-1023
        ```
        
        This will return an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request range of bytes from the file.
        If the range cannot be generated the Range header may be ignored and an `HTTP 200` response would be returned with the full contents of the file.
        
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
        Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048
        Content-Type: application/octet-stream
        
        <first 1024 bytes of file>
        ```
