summary:
  heading: Move a DriveItem to a new folder
  intro: |
    To move a DriveItem to a new parent item, your app requests to update the **parentReference** of the DriveItem to move.
    This is a special case of the [Update](xref:graph.driveitem_update) method.
    Your app can combine moving an item to a new container and updating other properties of the item into a single request.
    Items cannot be moved between [Drives](xref:graph.drive) using this request.
permissions:

    One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](xref:graph.permissions_reference).

httpRequest:
  heading: HTTP request
  sampleCode: |
    ```http
    PATCH /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}
    PATCH /groups/{group-id}/drive/{item-id}
    PATCH /me/drive/items/{item-id}
    PATCH /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
    PATCH /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
    ```
    
requestHeaders:
  heading: Optional request headers
  list:
  - name: if-match
    value: String
    description: If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided does not match the current eTag on the folder, a 412 Precondition Failed response is returned.
requestBody:
  heading: Request body
  intro: |
    In the request body, supply the new value for the **parentReference** property.
    Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.
    For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.
    **Note:** When moving items to the root of a drive your app cannot use the `"id:" "root"` syntax.
    Your app needs to provide the actual ID of the root folder for the parent reference.
response:
  heading: Response
  intro: |
    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resource in the response body.
