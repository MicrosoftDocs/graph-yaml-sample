  heading: Get directory objects from a list of ids
  intro: |
    Returns the directory objects specified in a list of ids.  NOTE: The directory objects returned are the full objects containing **all** their properties. The `$select` query option is not available for this operation.
    Some common uses for this function are to:
    
    * Resolve ids returned by functions (that return collections of ids) such as [getMemberObjects](directoryobject_getmemberobjects.md) or [getMemberGroups](directoryobject_getmembergroups.md)  to their backing directory objects.
    * Resolve ids persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.
