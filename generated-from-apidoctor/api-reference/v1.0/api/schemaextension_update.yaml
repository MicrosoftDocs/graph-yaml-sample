  heading: Update schemaExtension
  intro: |
    Update properties in the definition of the specified [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md).
    The update applies to all the resources that are included in the **targetTypes** property of the extension. These resources are among the 
    [supporting resource types](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#supported-resources).
    Only the app that created a schema extension (owner app) can make additive updates to the extension when the extension is in the **InDevelopment** or **Available** status. 
    That means the app cannot remove custom properties or target resource types from the definition. The app can, however, change the description of the extension.
