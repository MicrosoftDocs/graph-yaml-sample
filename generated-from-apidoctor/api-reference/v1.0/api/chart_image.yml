              ## Usage
              You can display the base-64 string inside an HTML image tag: `<img src="data:image/png;base64,{base-64 chart image string}/>`.
              For default behavior, use `Image(width=0,height=0,fittingMode='fit')`. Here is an example of a chart image returned with the default parameters.

              If you want to customize the display of the image, specify a height, width, and a fitting mode. Here is what the same chart image looks like if you retrieve it with these parameters: `Image(width=500,height=500,fittingMode='Fill')`.
