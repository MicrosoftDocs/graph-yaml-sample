summary:
  heading: "Create schemaExtension"
  intro: |
    Create a new [schemaExtension](xref:graph.schemaextension) definition to extend a [supporting resource type](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#supported-resources).
    Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource. The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app. Depending on the 
    [state](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#schema-extensions-lifecycle) of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension. 
    See examples of how to [define a schema extension that describes a training course](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#2-register-a-schema-extension-definition-that-describes-a-training-course), 
    use the schema extension definition to [create a new group with training course data](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#3-create-a-new-group-with-extended-data), and 
    [add training course data to an existing group](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#4-add-update-or-remove-custom-data-in-an-existing-group).

requestBody:
  heading: "Request body"
  intro: |
    In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [schemaExtension](xref:graph.schemaextension) object.
    The following table shows the properties that are required when you create a schema extension.
    |Parameter|Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |description|String|Description for the schema extension.
    |id|String|The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. <br>You can assign a value in one of two ways: <ul><li>Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}. As an example, `contoso_mySchema`. NOTE: Only verified domains under the following top-level domains are supported: `.com`,`.net`, `.gov`, `.edu` or `.org`. </li><li>Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the **id** assignment in this format: ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. An example would be `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.</li></ul>This property cannot be changed after creation.
    |owner|String|(Optional) The `appId` of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.  If not supplied, then the calling application's `appId` will be set as the owner. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you **must** supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
    |properties|[extensionSchemaProperty](xref:graph.extensionschemaproperty) collection|The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.
    |targetTypes|String collection|Set of Microsoft Graph resource types (that support schema extensions) that this schema extension definition can be applied to.
