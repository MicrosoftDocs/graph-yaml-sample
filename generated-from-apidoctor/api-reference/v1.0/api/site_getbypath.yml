summary:
  heading: "Get a site resource by path"
  intro: |
    Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
    A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.
    In addition to retrieving a [site by ID](xref:graph.site_get) you can retrieve a site based on server-relative URL path.
    
    * Site collection hostname (contoso.sharepoint.com)
    * Site path, relative to server hostname.
    
    There is also a reserved site identifier, `root`, which always references the root site for a given target, as follows:
    
    * `/sites/root`: The tenant root site.
    * `/groups/{group-id}/sites/root`: The group's team site.
