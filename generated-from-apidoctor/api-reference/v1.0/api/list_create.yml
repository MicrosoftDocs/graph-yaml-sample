        intro: |
          Here is an example of how to create a new generic list.
          **Note:** Custom columns are optional.
          In addition to any columns specified here, new lists are created with columns defined in the referenced **template**.
          If the **list** facet or **template** is unspecified, the list defaults to the `genericList` template, which includes a _Title_ column.
