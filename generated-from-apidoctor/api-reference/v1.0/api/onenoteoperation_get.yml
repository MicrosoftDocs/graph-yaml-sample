summary:
  heading: "Get onenoteOperation"
  intro: |
    Get the status of a long-running OneNote operation. This applies to operations that return the **Operation-Location** header in the response, such as `CopyNotebook`, `CopyToNotebook`, `CopyToSectionGroup`, `and CopyToSection`.   
    You can poll the Operation-Location endpoint until the `status` property returns `completed` or `failed`. 
    If the status is `completed`, the `resourceLocation` property contains the resource endpoint URI. 
    If the status is `failed`, the error and `@api.diagnostics` properties provide error information.
