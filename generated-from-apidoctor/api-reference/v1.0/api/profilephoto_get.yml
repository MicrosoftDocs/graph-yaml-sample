summary:
  heading: "Get photo"
  intro: |
    Get the specified [profilePhoto](xref:graph.profilephoto) or its metadata (profilePhoto properties).
    
    The supported sizes of HD photos on Office 365 are as follows: '48x48', '64x64', '96x96', '120x120', '240x240', 
    '360x360','432x432', '504x504', and '648x648'. Photos can be any dimension if they are stored in Azure Active Directory.
    You can get the metadata of the largest available photo, or specify a size to get the metadata for that photo size.
    If the size you request is not available, you can still get a smaller size that the user has uploaded and made available.
    For example, if the user uploads a photo that is 504x504 pixels, then all but the 648x648 size of photo will be available for download.
