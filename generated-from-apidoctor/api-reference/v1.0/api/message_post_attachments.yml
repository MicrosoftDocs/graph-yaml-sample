summary:
  heading: "Add attachment"
  intro: |
    Use this API to add an [attachment](xref:graph.attachment) to a message. 
    An attachment can be one of the following types:
    
    * A file ([fileAttachment](xref:graph.fileattachment) resource).
    * An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](xref:graph.itemattachment) resource).
    * A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](xref:graph.referenceAttachment) resource).
    
    All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](xref:graph.attachment)
    resource. 
    You can add an attachment to an existing message by posting to its attachments collection, or you can 
    add an attachment to a message that is being [created and sent on the fly](xref:graph.user_sendmail).
    Since there is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the 
    size of the attachment you can add to under 4MB.

    Attachments for a [message](xref:graph.message) in a user's mailbox.
