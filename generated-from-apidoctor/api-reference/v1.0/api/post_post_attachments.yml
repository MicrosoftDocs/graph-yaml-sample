summary:
  heading: Add attachment
  intro: |
    Use this API to add an [attachment](xref:graph.attachment) to a post. Since there
    is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the size of the attachment
    you can add to under 4MB.
    An attachment can be one of the following types:
    
    * A file ([fileAttachment](xref:graph.fileattachment) resource).
    * An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](xref:graph.itemattachment) resource).
    * A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](xref:graph.referenceAttachment) resource).
    
    All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](xref:graph.attachment)
    resource.
