summary:
  heading: "List items shared with the signed-in user"
  intro: |
    Retrieve a collection of [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resources that have been shared with the owner of the [Drive](xref:graph.drive).
permissions:
  heading: "Permissions"
  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).
  list:
  - resource: "Delegated (work or school account)"
    permission: "Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All"
  - resource: "Delegated (personal Microsoft account)"
    permission: "Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All"
  - resource: "Application"
    permission: "Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All"
  outro: |
    **Note:** while the /sharedWithMe request will succeed with Files.Read or Files.ReadWrite permissions, some properties may be missing.
    Additionally, without one of the  **All** permissions, shared items returned from this API will not be accessible.

response:
  heading: "Response"
  intro: |
    This returns a collection of [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resources which contain the DriveItem resources shared with the owner of the drive.
    In this example, since the drive is the user's default drive, this returns items shared with the signed in user.

remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    DriveItems returned from the **sharedWithMe** action will always include the [**remoteItem**](xref:graph.remoteitem) facet which indicates they are items from a different drive.
    To access the shared DriveItem resource, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:
    
    ```http
    GET /drives/{remoteItem-driveId}/items/{remoteItem-id}
    ```
