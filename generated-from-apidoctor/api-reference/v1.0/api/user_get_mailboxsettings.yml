summary:
  heading: "Get user mailbox settings"
  intro: |
    Get the user's [mailboxSettings](xref:graph.mailboxsettings). This includes settings for automatic replies (notify people automatically upon 
    receipt of their email), locale (language and country/region), and time zone, and working hours.
    You can view all mailbox settings, or, get specific settings.
    Time zone is one of the preferred settings a user can set up for the user's mailbox. Valid time zone formats include the Windows time zone format and [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) time zone](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) (also known as Olson time zone) format. The Windows format is the default. 
    When you get a user's preferred time zone, the time zone is returned in the format that it was set up. If you want that time zone to be in a specific format (Windows or IANA), you can first [update the preferred time zone in that format as a mailbox setting](xref:graph.user_update_mailboxsettings). Subsequently you will be able to get the time zone in that format. Alternatively, you can manage the format conversion separately in your app.
