  intro: |
    Use this API to create a new Attachment.
    An attachment can be one of the following types:
    
    * A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
    * An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
    * A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceAttachment.md) resource).
    
    All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
    resource.
