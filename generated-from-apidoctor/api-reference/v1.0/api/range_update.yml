    In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

    |formulas|Json|Represents the formula in A1-style notation.
    |formulasLocal|Json|Represents the formula in A1-style notation, in the user's language and number-formatting locale.  For example, the English "=SUM(A1, 1.5)" formula would become "=SUMME(A1; 1,5)" in German.

    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [Range](xref:graph.range) object in the response body.

- items:
  - request:
      heading: "Request"
      intro: |
        Here is an example of the request. It updates a range - values, number-format and formula. The `null` input is to instruct the API to ignore the cell for that particular input. The values, number-format and formulas can be independently updated or combined together in the same API call. 
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/worksheets/{sheet-id}/range(address='A1:B2')
        Content-type: application/json
