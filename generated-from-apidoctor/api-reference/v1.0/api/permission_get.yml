summary:
  heading: "Get sharing permission for a file or folder"
  intro: |
    Return the effective sharing permission for a particular permission resource.
    Effective permissions of an item can come from two sources: permissions set directly on the item itself or permissions that are inherited from the item's ancestors.
    Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the `inheritedFrom` property.
    This property is an [ItemReference](xref:graph.itemReference) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.
    SharePoint permission levels set on an item are returned with an 'SP' prefix. For example, SP.View Only, SP.Limited Access, SP.View Web Analytics Data. See [Full list of SharePoint roles](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721640.aspx#section1).

remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    The [Permission](xref:graph.permission) resource uses _facets_ to provide information about the kind of permission represented by the resource.
    Permissions with a [**link**](xref:graph.sharinglink) facet represent sharing links created on the item. 
    Sharing links contain a unique token that provides access to the item for anyone with the link.
    Permissions with a [**invitation**](xref:graph.sharinginvitation) facet represent permissions added by inviting specific users or groups to have access to the file.
