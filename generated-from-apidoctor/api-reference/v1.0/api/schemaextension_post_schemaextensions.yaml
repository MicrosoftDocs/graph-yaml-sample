  heading: Create schemaExtension
  intro: |
    Create a new [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) definition to extend a [supporting resource type](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#supported-resources).
    Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource. The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app. Depending on the 
    [state](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#schema-extensions-lifecycle) of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension. 
    See examples of how to [define a schema extension that describes a training course](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#2-register-a-schema-extension-definition-that-describes-a-training-course), 
    use the schema extension definition to [create a new group with training course data](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#3-create-a-new-group-with-extended-data), and 
    [add training course data to an existing group](../../../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#4-add-update-or-remove-custom-data-in-an-existing-group).

    In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.
    The following table shows the properties that are required when you create a schema extension.
    |Parameter|Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |description|String|Description for the schema extension.
    |id|String|The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. <br>You can assign a value in one of two ways: <ul><li>Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}. As an example, `contoso_mySchema`. NOTE: Only verified domains under the following top-level domains are supported: `.com`,`.net`, `.gov`, `.edu` or `.org`. </li><li>Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the **id** assignment in this format: ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. An example would be `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.</li></ul>This property cannot be changed after creation.
    |owner|String|(Optional) The `appId` of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.  If not supplied, then the calling application's `appId` will be set as the owner. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you **must** supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
    |properties|[extensionSchemaProperty](../resources/extensionschemaproperty.md) collection|The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.
    |targetTypes|String collection|Set of Microsoft Graph resource types (that support schema extensions) that this schema extension definition can be applied to.

        ##### Request 1
        The first example shows using a verified domain name, `graphlearn`, and a schema name, `courses`, to form a unique string for the **id** property of the 
        schema extension definition. The unique string is based on this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}.
        In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.
        
        ```http
        POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/schemaExtensions
        Content-type: application/json
        
        {
            "id":"graphlearn_courses",
            "description": "Graph Learn training courses extensions",
            "targetTypes": [
                "Group"
            ],
            "properties": [
                {
                    "name": "courseId",
                    "type": "Integer"
                },
                {
                    "name": "courseName",
                    "type": "String"
                },
                {
                    "name": "courseType",
                    "type": "String"
                }
