summary:
  heading: "List events"
  intro: |
    Get a list of [event](xref:graph.event) objects in the user's mailbox. The list contains single 
    instance meetings and series masters.
    Currently, this operation returns event bodies in only HTML format.
    To get expanded event instances, you can [get the calendar view](xref:graph.calendar_list_calendarview), or 
    [get the instances of an event](xref:graph.event_list_instances).

    ### Get events in another user's calendar
    If you have application permissions, or if you have the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, it's possible to 
    get events from another user's calendar. This section focuses on scenarios that involve delegated permissions.
    For example, your app has acquired delegated permissions from the user, John. Suppose another user, Garth, has shared a calendar with John. 
    You can get the events in that shared calendar by specifying Garth’s user ID (or user principal name) in the example query shown below.
    
    ```http
    GET /users/{Garth-id | Garth-userPrincipalName}/events
    ```
    
    This capability applies to all the supported GET events operations for an individual user, as listed in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section below. 
    It also applies if Garth has delegated his entire mailbox to John.
    If Garth has not shared his calendar with John, nor has he delegated his mailbox to John, specifying Garth’s user ID or user principal name in those GET operations 
    will return an error. In such cases, specifying a user ID or user principal name only works for getting events in the signed-in user’s own calendars, 
    and the query is equivalent to using the /me shortcut:
    
    ```http
    GET /me/events
    ```
    
    This capability is available in only GET operations of:
    
    * Shared contact folders, calendars, and message folders 
    * Contacts, events, and messages in shared folders
    * The above resources in delegated mailboxes
    
    This capability is not available in other operations for contacts, events, messages, and their folders.
