  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API, depending on the resource that contains the extension. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

    ### Get a specific extension in a known resource instance
    Use the same REST request as getting the resource instance, and identify the extension using the **extensions** 
    navigation property of that instance.
    
    ```http
    GET /devices/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/events/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/events/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/threads/{Id}/posts/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /organization/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
    ```

  - name: extensionId
    type: String
    description: Placeholder for an extension name which is a unique text identifier for an extension, or a fully qualified name which concatenates the extension type and unique text identifier. The fully qualified name is returned in the id property when you create the extension. Required.

        #### Request 1
        The first example shows 2 ways of referencing an extension and gets the extension in the specified message. The
        response is the same regardless of the way used to reference the extension.
        First, by its name: 
        
        ```http
        GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/AAMkAGE1M2IyNGNmLTI5MTktNDUyZi1iOTVl===/extensions/Com.Contoso.Referral
        ```
        
        Second, by its ID (fully qualified name):
        
        ```http
        GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/AAMkAGE1M2IyNGNmLTI5MTktNDUyZi1iOTVl===/extensions/Microsoft.OutlookServices.OpenTypeExtension.Com.Contoso.Referral
        ```
