    This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.
    By default, only a limited set of properties are returned ( _businessPhones, displayName, givenName, id, jobTitle, mail, mobilePhone, officeLocation, preferredLanguage, surname, userPrincipalName_ ). 
    To return an alternative property set, you must specify the desired set of [user](xref:graph.user) properties using the OData `$select` query parameter. For example, to return _displayName_, _givenName_, and _postalCode_, you would use the add the following to your query `$select=displayName,givenName,postalCode`
