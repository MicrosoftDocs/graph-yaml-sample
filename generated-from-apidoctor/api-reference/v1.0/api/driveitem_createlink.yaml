  heading: Create a sharing link for a DriveItem
  intro: |
    You can use **createLink** action to share a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) via a sharing link.
    The **createLink** action will create a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
    If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, the existing sharing link will be returned.
    DriveItem resources inherit sharing permissions from their ancestors.

            ## Creating company sharable links
            OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support company sharable links.
            These are similar to anonymous links, except they only work for members of the owning organization.
            To create a company sharable link, use the **scope** parameter with a value of `organization`.
remarks:
  heading: Remarks
  intro: |
    * Links created using this action do not expire unless a default expiration policy is enforced for the organization.
    * Links are visible in the sharing permissions for the item and can be removed by an owner of the item.
    * Links always point to the current version of a item unless the item is checked out (SharePoint only).
