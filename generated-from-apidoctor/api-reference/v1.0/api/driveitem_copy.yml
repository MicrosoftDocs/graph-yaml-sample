              ```http
              HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
              Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717

            outro: |
              The value of the `Location` header provides a URL for a service that will return the current state of the copy operation.
              You can use this info to [determine when the copy has finished](xref:graph.long_running_actions_overview).
remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    In many cases the copy action is performed asynchronously.
    The response from the API will only indicate that the copy operation was accepted or rejected, say due to the destination filename already being in use.
