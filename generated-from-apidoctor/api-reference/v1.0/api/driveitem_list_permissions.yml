summary:
  heading: List sharing permissions on a DriveItem
  intro: |
    List the effective sharing permissions of on a [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem).
  outro: |
    ## Access to sharing permissions
    The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.
    
    * For the owner of the item, all sharing permissions will be returned. This includes co-owners.
    * For a non-owner caller, only the sharing permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
    * Sharing permission properties that contain secrets (e.g. `shareId` and `webUrl`) are only returned for callers that are able to create the sharing permission.

httpRequest:
  heading: HTTP request
  sampleCode: |
    ```http
    GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions
    GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
    GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions

    ```
    
queryParameters:
  heading: Optional query parameters
  intro: |
    This method supports the `$select` [OData Query Parameters](xref:graph.query_parameters) to customize the response.
requestHeaders:
  heading: Optional request headers
  list:
  - name: if-none-match
    value: String
    description: If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an HTTP 304 Not Modified response is returned.
response:
  heading: Response
  intro: |
    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Permission](xref:graph.permission) resources in the response body.
    Effective sharing permissions of a DriveItem can come from two sources:
    
    * Sharing permissions applied directly on the DriveItem itself
    * Sharing permissions inherited from the DriveItem's ancestors
    
    Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the **inheritedFrom** property.
    This property is an [**itemReference**](xref:graph.itemreference) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.
    SharePoint permission levels set on an item are returned with an 'SP' prefix. For example, SP.View Only, SP.Limited Access, SP.View Web Analytics Data. See [Full list of SharePoint roles](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721640.aspx#section1).

            heading: Response
            intro: |
              This example response includes three permissions, the first is a sharing link with edit permissions, the second is an explicit permission for a user named John, which was inherited from a parent folder, and the third is a read-write sharing link created by an application.

remarks:
  heading: Remarks
  intro: |
    The **permissions** relationship of DriveItem cannot be expanded as part of a call to [get DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem_get) or a collection of DriveItems.
    You must access the permissions property directly.
