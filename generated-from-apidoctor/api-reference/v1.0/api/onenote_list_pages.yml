queryParameters:
  heading: "Optional query parameters"
  intro: |
    This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.
    The default query for pages returns the top 20 pages ordered by `lastModifiedTime desc`. If the default query returns more than 20 pages, the response contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set. The maximum number of pages returned for a `top` request is 100.
    The default response expands `parentSection` and selects the section's `id`, `displayName`, and `self` properties. Valid `expand` values for pages are `parentNotebook` and `parentSection`.
