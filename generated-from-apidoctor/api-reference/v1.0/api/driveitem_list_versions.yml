summary:
  heading: "Listing versions of a DriveItem"
  intro: |
    OneDrive and SharePoint can be configured to retain the history for files.
    Depending on the service and configuration, a new version can be created for each edit, each time the file is saved, manually, or never.
    Previous versions of a document may be retained for a finite period of time depending on admin settings which may be unique per user or location.

    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [DriveItemVersion](xref:graph.driveitemversion) objects in the response body.
remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    OneDrive does not preserve the complete metadata for previous versions of a file.
    When your app retrieves the list of available versions for a file, a [DriveItemVersion](xref:graph.driveItemVersion) resource is returned that provides the available information about the specific version.
