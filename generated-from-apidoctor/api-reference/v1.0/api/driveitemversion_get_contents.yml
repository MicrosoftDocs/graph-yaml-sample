response:
  heading: "Response"
  intro: |
    Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the bytes of the file.
    To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
    Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immedately.
    Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.
remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    OneDrive does not preserve the complete metadata for previous versions of a file.
    When your app retrieves the list of available versions for a file, a [DriveItemVersion](xref:graph.driveItemVersion) resource is returned that provides the available information about the specific version.
