    ### Create an extension in a new resource instance
    Use the same REST request that you use to create the instance.
    
    ```http
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages
    POST /groups/{id}/events
    POST /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/reply
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts
    ```
    
    
    See the [Request body](#request-body) section about including the properties of the new resource instance _and the extension_ in the request body.

Request body:
  heading: Request body
  intro: |
    Provide a JSON body of an [openTypeExtension](../resources/openTypeExtension.md), with the following required
    name-value pairs, and any additional custom data. The data in the JSON payload can be primitive types, or arrays of
    primitive types.
    |Name|Value
    |:-|:-|
    |@odata.type|microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension
    |extensionName|%unique_string%
    When creating an extension in a _new_ resource instance, in addition to the
    new **openTypeExtension** object, provide a JSON representation of the relevant properties to create such a resource instance.
Response:
  heading: Response
  outro: |
    ### Response code
    Depending on the operation, the response code can be `201 Created` or `202 Accepted`.
    When you create an extension using the same operation that you use to create a resource instance, the operation returns the same response code that it returns when you use the operation to create the resource instance without the extension.
    Refer to the corresponding topics for creating the instance, as listed [above](#create-an-extension-in-a-new-resource-instance).
    |Scenario|Resource|Response body
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |Creating an extension while explicitly creating a _new_ resource instance|[contact](../resources/contact.md), [event](../resources/event.md), [message](../resources/message.md)|Includes the new instance expanded with the [openTypeExtension](../resources/openTypeExtension.md) object.
    |Creating an extension while implicitly creating a resource instance|[post](../resources/post.md)|The response includes only a response code but not a response body.
    |Creating an extension in an _existing_ resource instance|All supported resources|Includes the **openTypeExtension** object.

        ### Request 1
        The first example creates a message and an extension in the same call. The request body includes the following:
        
        * The **subject**, **body**, and **toRecipients** properties typical of a new message.
        * And for the extension:
            * The type `microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension`.
            * The extension name "Com.Contoso.Referral".
            * Additional data to be stored as three custom properties in the JSON payload: `companyName`, `expirationDate`, and `dealValue`.
        
        
        ```http
        POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages
        
        {
          "subject": "Annual review",
          "body": {
            "contentType": "HTML",
            "content": "You should be proud!"
          },
          "toRecipients": [
            {
              "emailAddress": {
                "address": "rufus@contoso.com"
              }
            }
          ],
          "extensions": [
            {
              "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
              "extensionName": "Com.Contoso.Referral",
              "companyName": "Wingtip Toys",
              "expirationDate": "2015-12-30T11:00:00.000Z",
              "dealValue": 10000
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
