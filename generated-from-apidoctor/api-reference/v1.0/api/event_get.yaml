  heading: Get event
  intro: |
    Get the properties and relationships of the specified [event](../resources/event.md) object.
    Currently, this operation returns event bodies in only HTML format.
    Since the **event** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in an **event** instance.

    ### Get events in another user's calendar
    If you have application permissions, or if you have the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, it's possible to get events 
    from another user's calendar. This section focuses on scenarios that involve delegated permissions.
    For example, your app has acquired delegated permissions from the user, John. Suppose another user, Garth, has shared a calendar with John. 
    You can get an event in that shared calendar by specifying Garth’s user ID (or user principal name) in the example query shown below.
    
    ```http
    GET /users/{Garth-id | Garth-userPrincipalName}/events/{id}
    ```
    
    This capability applies to all the supported GET events operations for an individual user, as listed in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section below . 
    It also applies if Garth has delegated his entire mailbox to John.
    If Garth has not shared his calendar with John, nor has he delegated his mailbox to John, specifying Garth’s user ID or user principal name in those GET operations 
    will return an error. In such cases, specifying a user ID or user principal name only works for getting an event in the signed-in user’s own calendars, 
    and the query is equivalent to using the /me shortcut:
    
    ```http
    GET /me/events/{id}
    ```
    
    This capability is available in only GET operations of:
    
    * Shared contact folders, calendars, and message folders 
    * Contacts, events, and messages in shared folders
    * The above resources in delegated mailboxes
    
    This capability is not available in other operations for contacts, events, messages, and their folders.

        The first example gets the specified event. It specifies the following:
        
        * A `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to get date time values returned in Pacific Standard Time. 
        * A `$select` query parameter to return specific properties. Without a `$select` parameter, all of the event properties will be returned.
