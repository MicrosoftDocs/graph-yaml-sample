summary:
  heading: "Get post"
  intro: |
    Get the properties and relationships of a post in a specified thread. You can specify both the parent 
    conversation and the thread, or, you can specify the thread without referencing the parent conversation.
    Since the **post** resource supports [extensions](xref:graph.extensibility_overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **post** instance.
