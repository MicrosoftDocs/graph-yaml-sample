            intro: |
              Here is an example of the request to create a new folder in the signed-in user's OneDrive root folder.
              The `@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior` property used indicates that if an item already exists with the same name, the service should choose a new name for the folder while creating it.

              ```http
              POST /me/drive/root/children
              Content-Type: application/json
              
              {
                "name": "New Folder",
                "folder": { },
                "@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior": "rename"
              }
