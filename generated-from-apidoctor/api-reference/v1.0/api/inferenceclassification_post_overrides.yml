summary:
  heading: "Create inferenceClassificationOverride"
  intro: |
    Create an override for a sender identified by an SMTP address. Future messages from that SMTP address will be consistently classified 
    as specified in the override.
    **Note**
    
    * If an override already exists with the same STMP address, then the **classifyAs** and **name** fields of that override are updated with the provided values.
    * The maximum number of overrides supported for a mailbox is 1000, based on unique sender SMTP addresses.
    * The POST operation supports creating only one override at a time.
