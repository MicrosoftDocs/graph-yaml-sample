  heading: "Accessing shared DriveItems"
  intro: |
    Access a shared [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) or a collection of shared items by using a **shareId** or sharing URL.
    To use a sharing URL with this API, your app needs to [transform the URL into a sharing token](#encoding-sharing-urls).
permissions:
  heading: "Permissions"
  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

  - resource: "Delegated (work or school account)"
    permission: "Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All"
  - resource: "Delegated (personal Microsoft account)"
    permission: "Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All"

    ### Encoding sharing URLs
    To encode a sharing URL, use the following logic:
    
    1. First, use base64 encode the URL.
    1. Convert the base64 encoded result to [unpadded base64url format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) by removing `=` characters
       from the end of the value, replacing `/` with `_` and `+` with `-`.)
    1. Append `u!` to be beginning of the string.
    
    As an example, to encode a URL in C#:
    string sharingUrl = "https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1231244193912!12&authKey=1201919!12921!1";
    string base64Value = System.Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharingUrl));
    string encodedUrl = "u!" + base64Value.TrimEnd('=').Replace('/','_').Replace('+','-');

  intro: |
    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [sharedDriveItem](xref:graph.shareddriveitem) resource in the response body.
