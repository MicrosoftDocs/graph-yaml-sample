    Get an open extension ([openTypeExtension](xref:graph.openTypeExtension) object) identified by name or fully qualified name.
    The following table lists the three scenarios where you can get an open extension from a supported resource instance.
    |**GET scenario**|**Supported resources**|**Response body**
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |Get a specific extension from a known resource instance.|[Device](xref:graph.device), [event](xref:graph.event), [group](xref:graph.group), [group event](xref:graph.event), [group post](xref:graph.post), [message](xref:graph.message), [organization](xref:graph.organization), [personal contact](xref:graph.contact), [user](xref:graph.user)|Open extension only.
    |Get a known resource instance expanded with a specific extension.|Device, event, group, group event, group post, message, organization, personal contact, user|A resource instance expanded with the open extension.

httpRequest:
  heading: "HTTP request"
  intro: |
    This section lists the syntax for each of the three `GET` scenarios described above.
  outro: |
    ### Get a specific extension in a known resource instance
    Use the same REST request as getting the resource instance, and identify the extension using the **extensions** 
    navigation property of that instance.
    
    ```http
    GET /devices/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/events/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/events/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /groups/{Id}/threads/{Id}/posts/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /organization/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
    GET /users/{Id|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
    ```

  heading: "Path parameters"
  list:
  - name: "Id"
