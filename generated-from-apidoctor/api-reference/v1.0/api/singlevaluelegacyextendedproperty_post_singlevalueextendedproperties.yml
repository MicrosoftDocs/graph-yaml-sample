summary:
  heading: "Create single-value extended property"
  intro: |
    Create one or more single-value extended properties in a new or existing instance of a resource. 
    The following user resources are supported:
    
    * [message](xref:graph.message)
    * [mailFolder](xref:graph.mailfolder)
    * [event](xref:graph.event)
    * [calendar](xref:graph.calendar)
    * [contact](xref:graph.contact)
    * [contactFolder](xref:graph.contactfolder) 
    
    As well as the following group resources:
    
    * group [event](xref:graph.event)
    * group [calendar](xref:graph.calendar)
    * group [post](xref:graph.post) 
    
    See [Extended properties overview](xref:graph.extended-properties-overview) for more information about when to use 
    open extensions or extended properties, and how to specify extended properties.
permissions:
  heading: "Permissions"
  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API, depending on the resource you're
    creating the extended property in. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](xref:graph.permissions_reference).
    
    * Mail.ReadWrite
    * Calendars.ReadWrite
    * Contacts.ReadWrite
    * Group.ReadWrite.All
    
httpRequest:
  heading: "HTTP request"
  intro: |
    You can create extended properties in a new or existing resource instance.
    To create one or more extended properties in a _new_ resource instance, use the same REST request as creating the
    instance, and include the properties of the new resource instance _and extended property_ in the request body.
    Note that some resources support creation in more than one way. For more information on creating these resource instances,
    see the corresponding topics for creating a [message](xref:graph.message), [mailFolder](xref:graph.user_post_mailfolders),
    [event](xref:graph.user_post_events), [calendar](xref:graph.user_post_calendars),
    [contact](xref:graph.user_post_contacts), [contactFolder](xref:graph.user_post_contactfolders),
    [group event](xref:graph.group_post_events), and [group post](xref:graph.post). 
    The following is the syntax of the requests. 
  samples:
  - sampleCode: |
    ```http
    POST /me/messages
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages
    POST /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
    
    POST /me/mailFolders
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailFolders
    
    POST /me/events
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events
    
    POST /me/calendars
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/calendars
    
    POST /me/contacts
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts
    
    POST /me/contactFolders
    POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contactFolders
    
    POST /groups/{id}/events
    
    POST /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/reply
    POST /groups/{id}/conversations/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/reply
    POST /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/reply
    POST /groups/{id}/conversations/{id}/threads/{id}/reply
    POST /groups/{id}/threads
    POST /groups/{id}/conversations
    ```

    To create one or more extended properties in an existing resource instance, specify the instance in the
    request, and include the extended property in the request body.
    **Note** You cannot create an extended property in an existing group post.
    
    ```http
    PATCH /me/messages/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}
    PATCH /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/{id}
    
    PATCH /me/mailFolders/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}
    
    PATCH /me/events/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events/{id}
    
    PATCH /me/calendars/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/calendars/{id}
    
    PATCH /me/contacts/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}
    
    PATCH /me/contactFolders/{id}
    PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}
    
    PATCH /groups/{id}/events/{id}
    ```

requestBody:
  heading: "Request body"
  intro: |
    Provide a JSON body of each [singleValueLegacyExtendedProperty](xref:graph.singleValueLegacyExtendedProperty) object in the 
    **singleValueExtendedProperties** collection property of the resource instance.
    |Property|Type|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |singleValueExtendedProperties|[singleValueLegacyExtendedProperty](xref:graph.singleValueLegacyExtendedProperty) collection|An array of one or more single-valued extended properties.
    |id|String|For each property in the **singleValueExtendedProperties** collection, specify this to identify the property. It must follow one of the supported formats. See [Outlook extended properties overview](xref:graph.extended-properties-overview) for more information. Required.
    |value|string|For each property in the **singleValueExtendedProperties** collection, specify the property value. Required.
    When creating an extended property in a _new_ resource instance, in addition to the 
    new **singleValueExtendedProperties** collection, provide a JSON representation of that resource instance (that is, a [message](xref:graph.message), 
    [mailFolder](xref:graph.mailfolder), [event](xref:graph.event), etc.)
response:
  heading: "Response"
  outro: |
    #### Response code
    An operation successful in creating an extended property in a new resource instance returns `201 Created`, except in a new group post, 
    depending on the method used, the operation can return `200 OK` or `202 Accepted`.
    In an existing resource instance, a successful create operation returns `200 OK`. 
    When creating an extended property, the response includes only the new or existing instance but not the new extended property. To see the newly
    created extended property, [get the instance expanded with the extended property](xref:graph.singlevaluelegacyextendedproperty_get).
    When creating an extended property in a _new_ [group post](xref:graph.post) by replying to a thread or post, the response includes only 
    a response code but not the new post nor the extended property.

          ##### Request 1
          The first example creates a new event and a single-value extended property in the same POST operation. Apart from the properties you'd normally 
          include for a new event, the request body includes the **singleValueExtendedProperties** collection that contains one single-value 
          extended property, and the following for the property:
          - **id** specifies the property type as `String`, the GUID, and the property named `Fun`.
          - **value** specifies `Food` as the value of the `Fun` property.
