summary:
  heading: "Track changes for a Drive"
  intro: |
    This method allows your app to track changes to a drive and its children over time.
    Your app begins by calling `delta` without any parameters. 
    The service starts enumerating the drive's hierarchy, returning pages of items and either an `@odata.nextLink` or an `@odata.deltaLink`, as described below.
    Your app should continue calling with the `@odata.nextLink` until you no longer see an `@odata.nextLink` returned, or you see a response with an empty set of changes.
    After you have finished receiving all the changes, you may apply them to your local state.
    To check for changes in the future, call `delta` again with the `@odata.deltaLink` from the previous response.
    Deleted items are returned with the [`deleted` facet](xref:graph.deleted). 
    Items with this property set should be removed from your local state. 
    **Note:** you should only delete a folder locally if it is empty after syncing all the changes.

      ```http
      GET /drives/{drive-id}/root/delta
      GET /groups/{groupId}/drive/root/delta

queryParameters:
  heading: "Optional query parameters"
  intro: |
    This method supports the `$select`, `$expand`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](../../../concepts/query_parameters.md) to customize the response.
parameters:
  heading: "Parameters"
  list:
  - name: "token"
    value: "String"
    description: "Optional. If unspecified, enumerates the hierarchy's current state. If latest, returns empty response with latest delta token. If a previous delta token, returns new state since that token."
response:
  heading: "Response"
  intro: |
    If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [DriveItem](xref:graph.driveitem) resources in the response body.
    In addition to the collection of DriveItems, the response will also include one of the following properties:
    |Name|Value|Description
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |**@odata.nextLink**|url|A URL to retrieve the next available page of changes, if there are additional changes in the current set.
    |**@odata.deltaLink**|url|A URL returned instead of **@odata.nextLink** after all current changes have been returned. Used to read the next set of changes in the future.
remarks:
  heading: "Remarks"
  intro: |
    * The delta feed shows the latest state for each item, not each change. If an item were renamed twice, it would only show up once, with its latest name.
    * The same item may appear more than once in a delta feed, for various reasons. You should use the last occurrence you see.
    * The `parentReference` property on items will not include a value for **path**. This occurs because renaming a folder does not result in any descendants of the folder being returned from **delta**. **When using delta you should always track items by id**.
    * In OneDrive for Business and SharePoint, `delta` is only supported on the `root` folder, not on other folders within a drive.
    * Delta will not return the following DriveItem properties:
    * **cTag**
    * **lastModifiedBy**
    * **size**
