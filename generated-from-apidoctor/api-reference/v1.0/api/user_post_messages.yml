  intro: |
    Use this API to create a draft of a new message. Drafts can be created in any folder and optionally updated before sending. To save to the Drafts folder, use the /messages shortcut.
    While creating the draft in the same **POST** call, you can include an [attachment](xref:graph.attachment).
permissions:

  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

requestBody:
  heading: "Request body"
  intro: |
    In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [message](xref:graph.message) object.
    Since the **message** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the message while creating it.
response:
  heading: "Response"
  intro: |
    If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [message](xref:graph.message) object in the response body.
