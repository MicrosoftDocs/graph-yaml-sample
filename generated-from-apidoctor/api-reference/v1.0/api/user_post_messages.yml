  intro: |
    Use this API to create a draft of a new message. Drafts can be created in any folder and optionally updated before sending. To save to the Drafts folder, use the /messages shortcut.
    While creating the draft in the same **POST** call, you can include an [attachment](xref:graph.attachment).
permissions:

  intro: |
    One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

  intro: |
    In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [message](xref:graph.message) object.

response:
  heading: "Response"
