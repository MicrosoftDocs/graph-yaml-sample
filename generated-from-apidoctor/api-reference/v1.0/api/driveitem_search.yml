      heading: "Request"
      intro: |
        Here is an example of the request searching the current user's OneDrive
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        GET /me/drive/root/search(q='{search-query}')
        ```
        
     response:
      heading: "Response"
      intro: |
        This method returns an object containing an collection of [DriveItems](xref:graph.driveitem) that match the search criteria.
        If no items were found, an empty collection is returned.
        If there are too many matches the response will be paged and an **@odata.nextLink** property will contain a URL to the next page of results.
        You can use the `$top` query parameter to specify the number of items in the page.
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-type: application/json
        
        {
            "value": [

        ## Searching for items a user can access
        In addition to searching for items within a drive, your app can search more broadly to include items shared with the current user.
        To broaden the search scope, use the **search** method on the [Drive](xref:graph.drive) resource.
   - request:
      heading: "Example"
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        GET /me/drive/search(q='{search-query}')
        ```
        
     response:
      heading: "Response"
      intro: |
        Responses when searching from the **drive** resource may include items outside of the drive (items shared with the current user).
        These items will include the [**remoteItem**](xref:graph.remoteitem) facet to indicate they are stored outside of the target drive. 
      sampleCode: |
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-type: application/json
        
        {
            "value": [
              {
                "id": "0123456789abc!123",
                "name": "Contoso Project",
                "folder": {},
                "searchResult": { "onClickTelemetryUrl": "https://bing.com/0123456789abc!123" },
                "remoteItem": { "id": "!23141901", "parentReference": { "driveId": "s!1020101jlkjl12lx" } }
              },
              {
                "id": "0123456789abc!456",
                "name": "Contoso Project 2016",
                "folder": {},
                "searchResult": { "onClickTelemetryUrl": "https://bing.com/0123456789abc!456" }
              }
            ],
            "@odata.nextLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root/search(query='contoso project')&skipToken=1asdlnjnkj1nalkm!asd"
