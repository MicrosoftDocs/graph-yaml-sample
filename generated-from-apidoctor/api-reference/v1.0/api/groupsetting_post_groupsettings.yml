summary:
  heading: "Create a group setting"
  intro: |
    Use this API to create a new setting, based on the templates available in [groupSettingTemplates](xref:graph.groupsettingtemplate). These settings can be at the tenant-level or at the group level. The creation request must provide [settingValues](xref:graph.settingvalue) for all the settings defined in the template. For group-specific settings, only the setting governing whether members of a group can invite guest users can be set. This will govern this behavior once the ability to add guest users to a group is generally available.
    For a list of templates and the properties they support in v1.0, use a [groupSettingTemplate query](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=groupSettingTemplates&version=v1.0)  (For beta endpoints, call [directorySettingTemplates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=directorySettingTemplates&version=beta).)
