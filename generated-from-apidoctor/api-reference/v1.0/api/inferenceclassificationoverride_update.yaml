  heading: Update inferenceclassificationoverride
  intro: |
    Change the **classifyAs** field of an override as specified. 
    You cannot use PATCH to change any other fields in an [inferenceClassificationOverride](../resources/inferenceClassificationOverride.md) instance. 
    If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her display name, you can use [POST](inferenceclassification_post_overrides.md) to force an update to the name field in the existing override.
    If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her SMTP address, [deleting](inferenceclassificationoverride_delete.md) the existing override and [creating](inferenceclassification_post_overrides.md) a new one with 
    the new SMTP address is the only way to "update" the override for this sender.
