  intro: |
    Check for membership in the specified list of groups. Returns from the list those groups of which
    the user has a direct or transitive membership.
    You can check up to a maximum of 20 groups per request. This function supports Office 365 and other
    types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. Note that Office 365 Groups cannot contain groups. So membership
    in an Office 365 Group is always direct.
