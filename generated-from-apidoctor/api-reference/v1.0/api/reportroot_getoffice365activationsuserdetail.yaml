    If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.
    Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.
    The CSV file has the following headers for columns.
    
    * Report Refresh Date
    * User Principal Name
    * Display Name
    * Product Type
    * Last Activated Date
