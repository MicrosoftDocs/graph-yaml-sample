  intro: |
    List all the groups available in an organization, including but not limited to Office 365 Groups.
    The [default properties](../api/group_get.md#default-properties) of each group are returned.
    To list only Office 365 Groups (aka unified groups), apply a filter on **groupTypes**:
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')

    You can use the OData query option `$orderby` to sort groups in an organization by the **displayName**
    values, as shown in the following example:
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName
