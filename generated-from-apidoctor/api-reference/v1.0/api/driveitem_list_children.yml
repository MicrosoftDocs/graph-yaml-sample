        {

            {"name": "Documents", "folder": { "childCount": 4} },
            {"name": "Photos", "folder": { "childCount": 203} },
            {"name": "my sheet(1).xlsx", "size": 197 }
          ],
          "@odata.nextLink": "https://..."
        }
        ```
        
        
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-type: application/json
        
        {
          "value": [

            {"name": "Documents", "folder": { "childCount": 4} },

          "@odata.nextLink": "https://..."
        }
        ```
        
        **Note:** If a collection exceeds the default page size (200 items), the **@odata.nextLink** property is returned in the response to indicate more items are available and provide the request URL for the next page of items.
        You can control the page size through [optional query string parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters)
