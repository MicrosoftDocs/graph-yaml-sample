top:
  heading: Get photo
  intro: |
    Get the specified [profilePhoto](../resources/profilephoto.md) or its metadata (profilePhoto properties).
    
    The supported sizes of HD photos on Office 365 are as follows: '48x48', '64x64', '96x96', '120x120', '240x240', 
    '360x360','432x432', '504x504', and '648x648'. Photos can be any dimension if they are stored in Azure Active Directory.
    You can get the metadata of the largest available photo, or specify a size to get the metadata for that photo size.
    If the size you request is not available, you can still get a smaller size that the user has uploaded and made available.
    For example, if the user uploads a photo that is 504x504 pixels, then all but the 648x648 size of photo will be available for download.
    If the specified size is not available in the user's mailbox or in Azure Active Directory, the size of '1x1' is returned with the rest of 
    metadata.
