  heading: Add custom data to resources using extensions
  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph provides a single API endpoint that gives you access to rich people-centric data and insights through a number of resources such as [user](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/user.md) and [message](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/message.md). You can also extend Microsoft Graph with your own application data. You can add custom properties to Microsoft Graph resources without requiring an external data store.
    For example, you might decide to keep your app lightweight and store app-specific user profile data in Microsoft Graph by extending the **user** resource. Alternatively, you might want to retain your appâ€™s existing user profile store, and simply add an app-specific store identifier to the **user** resource.
    Microsoft Graph offers two types of extensions. Choose the extension type that best suits your application needs:
    
    * **Open extensions**: A good way for developers to get started.
    * **Schema extensions**: A more versatile mechanism for developers who care about storing typed data, making their schema discoverable and shareable, being able to filter, and in the future, being able to perform input data validation and authorization.

    ## Supported resources
    The following table lists the resources that support open and schema extensions, and indicates whether they have reached general availability (GA - available in both the v1.0 and beta endpoints) or are in preview (available only in the beta endpoint).
    |Resource|Open extensions|Schema extensions
    |:------- -|:------ -|:------ -|
    |[Administrative unit](../api-reference/beta/resources/administrativeunit.md)|Preview only|Preview only
    |[Calendar event](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/event.md)|GA|GA
    |[Device](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/device.md)|GA|GA
    |[Group](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/group.md)|GA|GA
    |[Group calendar event](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/event.md)|GA|GA
    |[Group conversation post](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/post.md)|GA|GA
    |[Message](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/message.md)|GA|GA
    |[Organization](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/organization.md)|GA|GA
    |[Personal contact](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/contact.md)|GA|GA
    |[User](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/user.md)|GA|GA
    You can use extensions on all these resources when signed in with a work or school account. In addition, you can use extensions on the **event**, **post**, **group**, **message**, **contact**, and **user** resources when signed in with a personal account.
permissions:
  heading: Permissions
  intro: |
    The same [permissions](./permissions_reference.md) that are required to read from or write to a specific resource are also required to read from or write to any extensions data on that resource. For example, for an app to be able to update the signed-in user's profile with custom app data, the app must have been granted the *User.ReadWrite.All* permission.
    Additionally, to create and manage schema extension definitions, an application must be granted the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* permission.
