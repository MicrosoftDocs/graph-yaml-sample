  heading: Get started with Microsoft Graph in a PHP app
  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint and call  Microsoft Graph. It walks you through building the [Connect Sample for PHP (REST)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/php-connect-rest-sample) and explains the main concepts that you implement to use Microsoft Graph. The article also describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using REST calls.
    To use Microsoft Graph in your PHP app, you need to show the Microsoft sign in page to your users. The following screenshot shows a sign in page for Microsoft accounts.
