  heading: Get started with Microsoft Graph in an Objectve C iOS App
  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the [Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/converged_auth) and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through the code inside the [Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS (SDK)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample) to explain the main concepts that you have to implement in an app that uses Microsoft Graph. It describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using the [Microsoft Graph SDK for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ios).
    You can download the version of the app that you'll create from this GitHub repo:
    
    * [Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using the Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample)
    
    The following image shows the app you'll create.
    ![Connect sample walkthrough, shows connecting and sending a mail in the app](./images/iOSConnectWalkthrough.png)
    The workflow will be to connect/authenticate to Microsoft Graph, sign in with your work or personal account, and finally send a mail to a recipient.

    To get started, you'll need: 
    
    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple
    * Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) as a dependency manager
    * A [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com/) or a [work or school account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program-faq#account-types)
    * The [Microsoft Graph Starter Project for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample). This template contains classes that you'll add code to. To get this project, clone or download the sample project from this location, and you'll work with the workspace inside the **starter-project** folder (**ios-objectivec-connect-sample.xcworkspace**).
