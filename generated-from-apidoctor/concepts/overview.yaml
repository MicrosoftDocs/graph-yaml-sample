  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to take advantage of the tremendous amount of data in Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Windows 10. 
    You can use the Microsoft Graph API to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with the data of millions of users. With Microsoft Graph, you can connect to a wealth of resources, relationships, and intelligence, all through a single endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com`.

    ## What's in the graph?
    Microsoft Graph exposes APIs for:
    
    * Azure Active Directory
    * Office 365 services: SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook/Exchange, Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Planner, and Excel
    * Enterprise Mobility and Security services: Identity Manager, Intune, Advanced Threat Analytics, and Advanced Threat Protection.
    * Windows 10 services: activities and devices
    * Education
    
    To find out more, see 
    [Major services and features in Microsoft Graph](../concepts/overview-major-services.md).
    Microsoft Graph connects all the resources across these services using relationships. For example, a user can be connected to a group through a [memberOf](../api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list_memberof.md) relationship, and to another user through a [manager relationship](../api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list_manager.md). Your app can traverse these relationships to access these connected resources and perform actions on them through the API.
    You can also get valuable insights and intelligence about the data from Microsoft Graph. For example, you can get the popular files [trending around](../api-reference/beta/resources/insights_trending.md) a particular user, or [get the most relevant people](../api-reference/beta/api/user_list_people.md) around a user.
    Discover the possibilities in the relationships within Microsoft Graph.
