    ## Use $select to select the minimum set of properties you need
    When you query for a resource (for example, sections inside a notebook), you make a request similar to the following.
    GET ~/notebooks/{id}/sections

    This retrieves all the properties of the sections. However, you might not need all properties. You can use the `$select` query parameter to return just the properties that you want, as shown in the following example.
    GET ~/notebooks/{id}/sections?$select=id,displayName

    The same approach applies to other OneNote APIs.
