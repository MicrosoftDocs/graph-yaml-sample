  heading: Add custom data to users using open extensions
  intro: |
    We're going to walk you through an example to demonstrate how to use *open extensions*. 
    Imagine you're building an application that is available on lots of different client platforms, such as desktop and mobile.  You want to let users 
    configure their UI experience so itâ€™s consistent no matter which device they use to sign in to your app. This is a common requirement for most apps. 
    For this scenario, we're going to show you how to:
    
    1. Add an open extension representing some roaming profile information about the user.
    1. Query the user and return the roaming profile.
    1. Change the user's roaming profile information (the open extension value).
    1. Delete the user's roaming profile information.

    ## 1. Add roaming profile information
    The user signs in to the app and configures the look and feel of the app.  These app settings should roam so that the user gets the same experience on 
    whatever device they sign in to the app from.  Here we'll see how to add the roaming profile information to a user resource.

    ## 2. Retrieve roaming profile information
    When the user signs in to the app from another device, the app can retrieve the user's profile details as well as their roaming settings. This can be done by getting the user's resource and expanding the extension navigation property.
