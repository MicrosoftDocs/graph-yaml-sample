  heading: Use the Microsoft Graph API
  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. After you [register your app](auth_register_app_v2.md) and [get authentication tokens for a user](auth_v2_user.md) or [service](auth_v2_service.md), you can make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
    
    To read from or write to a resource such as a user or an email message, you construct a request that looks like the following.
    https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{resource}?query-parameters

    The components of a request include:
    
    * [HTTP method](#http-methods) - The HTTP method used on the request to Microsoft Graph.
    * [`{version}`](#version) - The version of the Microsoft Graph API your application is using.
    * [`{resource}`](#resource) - The resource in Microsoft Graph that you're referencing.
    * [query-parameters](#query-parameters-optional) - An optional set of parameters to modify the request or response.
    
    After you make a request, a response is returned that includes: 
    
    * Status code - An HTTP status code that indicates success or failure. For details about HTTP error codes, see [Errors](errors.md).
    * Response message - The data that you requested or the result of the operation. The response message can be empty for some operations.
    * **Next** link - If your request returns a lot of data, you need to page through it by choosing **Next**. For details, see [Paging](paging.md).

    ## HTTP methods
    Microsoft Graph uses the HTTP method on your request to determine what your request is doing. The API supports the following methods.
    |**Method**|**Description**
    | :----- -| :------------------------------------------- -|
    |GET|Read data from a resource.
    |POST|Create a new resource, or perform an action.
    |PATCH|Update a resource with new values.
    |PUT|Replace a resource with a new one.
    |DELETE|Remove a resource.
    
    * For the methods **GET** and **DELETE**, no request body is required.
    * The **POST**, **PATCH**, and **PUT** methods require a request body, usually specified in JSON format, that contains additional information, such as the values for properties of the resource.
