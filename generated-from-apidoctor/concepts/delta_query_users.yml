summary:
  heading: "Get incremental changes for users"
  intro: |
    [Delta query](xref:graph.delta_query_overview) lets you query for additions, deletions, or updates to users, by way of a series of [delta](xref:graph.user_delta) function calls. Delta query enables you discover changes to users without having to fetch the entire set of users from Microsoft Graph and compare changes.
    Clients using synchronizing users with a local profile store can use Delta Query for both their initial full synchronization along with incremental synchronizations in the future. Typically, a client would do an initial full synchronization of all the users in a tenant, and subsequently, get incremental changes to users periodically.

    ## Tracking user changes
    Tracking user changes is a round of one or more GET requests with the **delta** function. You make a GET request much like the way you [list users](xref:graph.user_list), except that you include the following:
    
    * The **delta** function.
    * A [state token](xref:graph.delta_query_overview) (_deltaToken_ or _skipToken_) from the previous GET **delta** function call.
