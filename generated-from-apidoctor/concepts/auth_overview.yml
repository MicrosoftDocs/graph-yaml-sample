  heading: Get access tokens to call Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    To call Microsoft Graph, your app must acquire an access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft's cloud identity service. The access token contains information (or claims) about your app and the permissions it has for the resources and APIs available through Microsoft Graph. To get an access token, your app must be able to authenticate with Azure AD and be authorized by either a user or an administrator for access to the Microsoft Graph resources it needs. 
    This topic provides an overview of access tokens, Azure AD, and how your app can get access tokens. If you are already familiar with integrating an app with Azure AD to get tokens, then you can skip ahead to [Next Steps](#next-steps) for information and samples specific to Microsoft Graph.

    ## What is an access token and how do I use it?
    Access tokens issued by Azure AD are base 64 encoded JSON Web Tokens (JWT). They contain information (claims) that web APIs secured by Azure AD, like Microsoft Graph, use to validate the caller and to ensure that the caller has the proper permissions to perform the operation they're requesting. When calling Microsoft Graph, you can treat access tokens as opaque. You should always transmit access tokens over a secure channel, such as transport layer security (HTTPS).
    Here's an example of an Azure AD access token:

    To call Microsoft Graph, you attach the access token as a Bearer token to the Authorization header in an HTTP request. For example, here's a call that returns the profile information of the signed-in user (the access token has been truncated for readability):
    HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer EwAoA8l6BAAU ... 7PqHGsykYj7A0XqHCjbKKgWSkcAg==
    Host: graph.microsoft.com`
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/
