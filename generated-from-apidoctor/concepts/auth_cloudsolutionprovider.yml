  heading: Call Microsoft Graph from a Cloud Solution Provider application
  intro: |
    This topic describes how to enable application access to partner-managed customer data via Microsoft Graph using either the [authorization code grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code) or the [service to service client credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service).
    **Important:** Calling Microsoft Graph from a CSP application is only supported for directory resources (such as **user**, **group**,**device**, **organization**) and [Intune](xref:graph.intune_graph_overview) resources.

    ## What is a partner-managed application
    The CSP program enables Microsoft’s partners to resell and manage Microsoft Online Services (such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, and CRM Online) to customers. Management of customer services is done through Delegated Admin Privileges, which enables designated partner users (known as agents) to access and configure their customers’ environments.
    Additionally, as a partner developer, you can build a **partner-managed app** to manage your customers' Microsoft services. Partner-managed apps are often called *pre-consented* apps because all your customers are automatically pre-consented for your partner-managed apps. This means when a user from one of your customer tenants uses one of your partner-managed apps, the user can use it without being prompted to give consent. Partner-managed apps also inherit Delegated Admin Privileges, so your partner agents can also get privileged access to your customers through your partner-managed application.
