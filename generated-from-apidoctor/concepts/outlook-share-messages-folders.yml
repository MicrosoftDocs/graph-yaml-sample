summary:
  heading: Share Outlook message folders between users
  intro: |
    Outlook lets customers share folders with one another and provide "read", "create", or "modify" access to individual folders or the entire mailbox. This is also 
    known as "delegation" in Outlook.
    Programmatically, Microsoft Graph supports getting messages in mail folders that have been shared by other users, as well as getting the shared folders themselves.
    As an example, Garth has shared with John read access to Garth's Inbox. If John has signed in your app and provided delegated permissions (Mail.Read.Shared or
    Mail.ReadWrite.Shared), your app will be able to access Garth's mail and Garth's Inbox as described below.
  outro: |
    ## Get a message in the shared folder
    You can get a specific message in Garth's Inbox:
    
    ```http
    GET users/{Garth-userId | Garth-userPrincipalName}/mailfolders('Inbox')/messages/{id}
    ```
    
    On successful completion, you'll get HTTP 200 OK and the [message](xref:graph.message) instance identified by `{id}` from Garth's Inbox.
