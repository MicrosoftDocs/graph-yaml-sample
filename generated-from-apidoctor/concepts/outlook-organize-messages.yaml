  heading: Organize Outlook messages
  intro: |
    Outlook lets customers organize their messages the way they like it, be it leaving all messages in the same Inbox folder, or organizing messages in a tree-like folder structure under the Inbox to fit their specific needs. You can conveniently [filter, search, or sort](query_parameters.md) messages in the user's
    entire mailbox or in specific folders.

    ## Accessing mail folders
    Programmatically, message folders are represented by the [mailFolder](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/mailfolder.md) resource, and the Inbox is one of the
    folders at the root of the folder structure.
    Each **mailFolder** is identified by its folder ID, and has a writable **displayName** property. Outlook creates a few other folders for customers by default. You can reference these default folders by their folder IDs, or by their well-known names. For a list of available well-known folder names, see [mailFolder resource type](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/mailfolder.md).
    For a custom, non-default folder, if you know its folder path, you can access the folder by first using the `/users/{id}/mailfolders` shortcut to get to the root level and get all the top level folders:
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/mailFolders

    Then, specify the appropriate folder ID (`{folder_id}`) as you navigate each level of the folder tree:
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/mailFolders/{folder_id}/childfolders

    Repeat until you finally get to the custom folder in the tree.
