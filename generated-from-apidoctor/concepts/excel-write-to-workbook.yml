  heading: Write data to an Excel workbook with Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    The Excel REST API provides an easy, platform-agnostic way to upload information to an Excel workbook. This topic shows you how to write simple data sets to an Excel workbook on three web development frameworks: ASP.NET, Angular, and React. You can look at the code samples featured in this topic by visiting the [Microsoft Graph Excel starter samples on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftgraph?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=excelstarter).
    
    All three of the Excel starter samples do the same thing: retrieve the name and address of the signed-in user and add those two pieces of information to a new row in the **demo.xlsx** workbook. You can modify the samples to add additional rows simply by adding information to the two-dimensional array that represents the row or rows that you want to add.

    ## Add a row or rows to an Excel workbook with a single REST request
    The Excel REST API requires you to POST a simple request body to the REST endpoint that represents the row collection of an Excel workbook. If you're working with a notebook in the root folder of the signed-in user's OneDrive account, the REST endpoint will look like this:
    `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/demo.xlsx:/workbook/tables/Table1/rows/add`
    For more information about how to reach files in OneDrive folders, see the [DriveItem resource type](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/driveitem) in our reference documentation.
    
    The POST body looks like this:
    `{
      "index": null,
      "values": [
        ['alex darrow', 'adarrow@tenant.onmicrosoft.com']
      ]
    }`
    The value of the first `index` parameter specifies the relative position of the row that you're adding to the zero-indexed array of rows. Rows below the inserted row will be shifted downwards. The `null` parameter indicates that the new row will be added to the end.
    The value of the second `values` parameter is a two-dimensional string array that contains the unformatted values of each row that you want to add. The array in the sample contains only one row, but you can add more rows by adding more string arrays.
    You can test this query with your own OneDrive account by uploading the demo.xlsx file to your OneDrive root folder and executing this query on the [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).
    That is all you need to know in order to write data to an Excel workbook. You do need to know how to construct and make the request in your own framework, and the Excel starter samples demonstrate three separate ways of doing this.
