summary:
  heading: "Get OneNote content and structure with Microsoft Graph"
  intro: |
    **Applies to**: Consumer notebooks on OneDrive | Enterprise notebooks on Office 365
    To get OneNote content and structure, you send a GET request to the target endpoint. For example:
    `GET ../onenote/pages/{id}`
    If the request is successful, Microsoft Graph returns a 200 HTTP status code and the entities or content that you requested. OneNote entities are returned as JSON objects that conform to the OData version 4.0 specification.
    By using query string options, you can filter your queries and improve performance.

    ## Construct the request URI
    To construct the request URI, start with the service root URL:
    `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/onenote`
    <br/>
    Then append the endpoint of the resource you want to retrieve. ([Resource paths](#resource-paths-for-get-requests) are shown in the next section.)
    Your full request URI will look like one of these examples:
    
    * `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/onenote/notebooks/{id}/sections`
    * `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/onenote/notes/pages`
    * `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/onenote/pages?select=title,self`
    
    
    <a name="resource-paths"></a>
