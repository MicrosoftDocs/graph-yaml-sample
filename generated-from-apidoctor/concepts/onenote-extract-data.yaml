    ## Extraction attributes
    To extract and transform data, simply include a div that specifies the source content, extraction method, and fallback behavior in your [create-page](onenote-create-page.md) or [update-page](onenote_update_page.md) request. The API renders extracted data on the page in an easy-to-read format. 
    <div
      data-render-src="image-or-url"
      data-render-method="extraction-method"
      data-render-fallback="fallback-action">
    </div>
