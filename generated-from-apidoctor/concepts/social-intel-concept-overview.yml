  heading: "Overview of social intelligence and analytics in Microsoft Graph"
  intro: |
    The hundreds of millions of users of Microsoft 365 cloud services form part of the core of Microsoft Graph. The users' data is carefully managed, protected, and with proper authorization, made available by Microsoft Graph services to drive productivity and creativity in businesses. As ubiquitous the user's data is in Microsoft Graph, data derived from the user's social interactions is particularly interesting. It provides intelligent insights that can answer questions such as the following:
    
    * "Who should this user contact for information on this topic?"
    * "Which documents are most interesting to this person?"
    
    You can use the people API and insights API in Microsoft Graph to build smarter apps that can, respectively, access the relevant people and documents for a user.
    The people API returns people ordered by relevance to a user, based on that user's contacts, social networks, organization directory, and recent communications on email and Skype. This is particularly useful for people-picking scenarios.
    The insights API uses advanced analytics and machine learning to provide the most relevant files users need throughout their work day. The API powers familiar Office 365 experiences, including Office Delve, SharePoint Home, the Discover view in OneDrive for Business, and Outlook on the web.

    ## Why integrate with people data?
    The people API returns data of a single entity, [person](xref:graph.person), which includes typical data of an individual in today's business world. What makes this **person** data especially useful is its _relevance_ with respect to a Microsoft Graph user. Relevance is noted in a relevance score of each person, calculated based on the user's communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. There are 3 main types of application of this _relevance_ data.
