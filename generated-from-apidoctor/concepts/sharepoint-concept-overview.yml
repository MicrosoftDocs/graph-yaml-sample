  intro: |
    SharePoint is your mobile, intelligent intranet. With SharePoint, users can share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to empower teamwork, find information, and collaborate across an organization. You can use the SharePoint REST API in Microsoft Graph to integrate your solutions with SharePoint sites and content.

    ## Why integrate with SharePoint sites and content?
    SharePoint sites power team collaboration and communication. Office 365 groups, Microsoft Teams, and portals are all based on SharePoint, so you can use Microsoft Graph to access data no matter where it's kept. Use the SharePoint API in Microsoft Graph to access:
    
    * Team sites that store the content that users collaborate on with their coworkers.
    * Communication sites and portals where users publish rich content pages to share across the organization.
