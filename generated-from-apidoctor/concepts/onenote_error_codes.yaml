  heading: Error codes for OneNote APIs in Microsoft Graph
  intro: |
    This article describes error codes that are returned by the OneNote APIs in Microsoft Graph whenever a request sent through the API fails.
  outro: |
    ## Error response example
    When your request generates an error, the OneNote API stops performing the request and returns an error response as a JSON object. An error response contains the associated error code, a message, and a link to the appropriate section of this article. The following example shows how an error response looks.
    {
       "error":{
          "code":"10002",
          "message":"The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.",
          "innerError": {
            "requestId": "request-id",
            "date": "date-time"
          }
       }
    }
