    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through building the [Connect Sample for Android](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/android-java-connect-sample) and explains the main concepts that you implement to use Microsoft Graph in your app for Android. The article also describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using either the [Microsoft Graph SDK for Android](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-android) or raw REST calls.

    ## Configure a new project
    If you have downloaded the [Connect Sample for Android](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/android-java-connect-sample), skip this step. 
    Start a new project in Android Studio. You can leave the default values for most of the wizard; just make sure to choose the following options:
    
    * Target Android Devices: **Phone and Tablet**
    * Minimum SDK: **API 16: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)**
    * Add an Activity to Mobile: **Basic Activity**
    
    This provides you with an Android project with an activity and a button that you can use to authenticate the user.
