summary:
  heading: "Get incremental changes for groups"
  intro: |
    [Delta query](xref:graph.delta_query_overview) lets you query for additions, deletions, or updates to groups, by way of a series of [delta](xref:graph.group_delta) function calls. Delta query enables you discover changes to groups
    without having to fetch the entire set of groups from Microsoft Graph and compare changes.
    Clients using synchronizing groups with a local profile store can use Delta Query for both their initial full synchronization along with incremental synchronizations in the future. Typically, a client would do an initial full synchronization of all the groups in a tenant, and subsequently, get incremental changes to groups periodically.

    ## Tracking group changes
    Tracking group changes is a round of one or more GET requests with the **delta** function. You make a GET
    request much like the way you [list groups](xref:graph.group_list), except that you include the following:
    
    * The **delta** function.
    * A [state token](xref:graph.delta_query_overview) (*deltaToken* or *skipToken*) from the previous GET **delta** function call.
