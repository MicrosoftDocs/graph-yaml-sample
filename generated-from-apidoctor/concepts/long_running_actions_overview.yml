summary:
  heading: "Working with long running actions (beta)"
  intro: |
    Some API responses require indeterminate time to complete.
    Instead of waiting until the action is complete before returning a response, Microsoft Graph may use a long running actions pattern.
    This pattern provides your app a wait to poll for status updates on a long running action, without any request waiting for the action to complete.
    The general pattern follows these steps:
    
    1. Your app requests a long running action via the API. The API accepts the action and returns a `202 Accepted` response along with a Location header for the API URL to retrieve action status reports.
    1. Your app requests the action status report URL and receives an [AsyncJobStatus](xref:graph.asyncjobstatus) response with the progress of the long running action.
    1. The long running action completes. 
    1. Your app requests the action status report URL again and receives an [AsyncJobStatus](xref:graph.asyncjobstatus) response showing the completion of the action.

    ## Initial action request
    Let's walk through the steps for an example [DriveItem Copy](xref:graph.driveitem_copy) scenario.
    In this scenario, your app requests to copy a folder that contains a large amount of data.
    This request will likely take several seconds to complete since the amount of data is large.
    
    ```http
    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{folder-item-id}/copy
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "parentReference": {
        "path": "/drive/root:/Documents"
      },
      "name": "Copy of LargeFolder1"
    }
    ```
    
    The API responds that the action was accepted and the URL for retrieving the status of the long running action.
    
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
    Location: https://api.onedrive.com/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717
    ```
    
    **Note:** The location URL returned may not be on the Microsoft Graph API endpoint.
    In many cases this may be the end of the request, since the copy action will complete without the app doing any additional work.
    However, if your app needs to show the status of the copy action or ensure that it completes without error, it can do so using the monitor URL.

    The same [permissions](xref:graph.permissions_reference) that are required to perform a long running action are also required to query the status of a long running action.
