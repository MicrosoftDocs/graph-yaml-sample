  heading: Set up notifications for changes in user data
  intro: |
    The Microsoft Graph API uses a webhook mechanism to deliver notifications to clients. A client is a web service that configures its own URL to receive notifications. Client apps use notifications to update their state upon changes.
    After Microsoft Graph accepts the subscription request, it pushes notifications to the URL specified in the subscription. The app then takes action according to its business logic. For example, it fetches more data, updates its cache and views, etc.

    ## Supported resources
    Using the Microsoft Graph API, an app can subscribe to changes on the following resources:
    
    * Messages
    * Events
    * Contacts
    * Users
    * Groups
    * Group conversations
    * Content shared on OneDrive including drives associated with SharePoint sites
    * User's personal OneDrive folders
    
    For instance, you can create a subscription to a specific mail folder:
    `me/mailFolders('inbox')/messages`
    Or to a top-level resource:
    `me/messages`, `me/contacts`, `me/events`, `users`, or `groups`
    Or to a specific resource instance:
    `users/{id}`, `groups/{id}`, `groups/{id}/conversations`
    Or to a SharePoint/OneDrive for Business drive:
    `/drive/root`
    Or to a user's personal OneDrive:
    `/drives/{id}/root`
    `/drives/{id}/root/subfolder`
