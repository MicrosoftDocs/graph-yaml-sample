  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the [Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/converged_auth) and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through the code inside the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for UWP (Library)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/uwp-csharp-connect-sample) samples to explain the main concepts that you have to implement in an app that uses Microsoft Graph.
    **Don't feel like building an app?** Use the [Microsoft Graph quick start](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/quick-start) to get up and running fast, or download the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for UWP (Library)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/uwp-csharp-connect-sample) that this article is based on. Also note that we have a [REST version of this sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/uwp-csharp-connect-rest-sample).

    ## Sample user interface
    The sample contains a very simple user interface, consisting of a top command bar, a **connect button**, a **send mail** button, and a text box that is automatically populated with the signed-in user's e-mail address but that can be edited.
    The **send mail** button is disabled when the user has not connected:

    The top command bar contains a disconnect button when the user has connected:

    All of the sample's UI strings are stored in the Resources.resw file inside the Assets folder.

    To get started, you'll need: 
    
    * A [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com/) or a [work or school account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program-faq#account-types)
    * Visual Studio 2017 
    * The [Microsoft Graph Starter Project for UWP (Library)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/uwp-csharp-connect-sample/tree/master/starter). Both templates contain empty classes that you'll add code to. They also contains resource strings. To get this project, clone or download the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for UWP (Library)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/uwp-csharp-connect-sample) and then open the solution inside the **starter** folder.

    ## Register the app
    
    1. Sign into the [App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using either your personal or work or school account.
    1. Select **Add an app**.
    1. Enter a name for the app, and select **Create application**.
    1. The registration page displays, listing the properties of your app.
    1. Under **Platforms**, select **Add platform**.
    1. Select **Native Application**.
    1. Copy both the Client Id (App Id) and Redirect URI values to the clipboard. You'll need to enter these values into the sample app.
    1. The app id is a unique identifier for your app. The redirect URI is a unique URI provided by Windows 10 for each application to ensure that messages sent to that URI are only sent to that application. 
    1. Select **Save**.
