  heading: "Get started with Microsoft Graph and REST"
  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint and call Microsoft Graph using REST calls. It describes the sequence of requests and responses that an app uses to authenticate and retrieve email messages.
    First, you need register your app with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 
  outro: |
    ## Register the application
    There are currently two options to register your app with Azure AD.
    
    * Register an app to use the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint that works for both personal (Microsoft) identities and work and school (Azure AD) accounts.
    * Register an app to use the Azure AD endpoint that supports work and school accounts only.
    
    This article assumes a v2.0 registration, so you'll register your app on the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). Follow the instructions in [Register your Microsoft Graph application with the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](xref:graph.auth_register_app_v2) to register your app. For information about using the Azure AD endpoint, see [Authenticate using Azure AD](xref:graph.auth_v2_user).
