    ## Use Graph Explorer to get to know the API
    The easiest way to start exploring the data available through Microsoft Graph is to use [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge). Graph Explorer lets you craft REST requests (with full CRUD support), adapt the HTTP request headers, and see the data responses. To help you get started, Graph Explorer also provides a set of sample queries.
    Experiment with new APIs before you integrate them into your application.
