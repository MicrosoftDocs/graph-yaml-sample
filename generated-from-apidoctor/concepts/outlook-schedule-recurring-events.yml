  heading: "Schedule repeating appointments as recurring events in Outlook"
  intro: |
    Recurring events are an important part of Outlook calendaring. Whether it's a weekly one-on-one meeting with your manager, or a division-wide review meeting that happens on the second Tuesday of each month, recurring events make it easy to create the event once, and let the server fill in the rest of the series.
    The key bit of information that allows recurring events to "expand" into individual occurrences is the recurrence rule. The rule specifies both how often an event repeats, and for how long. The Outlook REST APIs model recurrence rules in the **recurrence** property of the [event resource](xref:graph.event). 
    Each recurrence is made up of two parts: the recurrence pattern (how often), and the recurrence range (for how long).

    ## Recurrence patterns
    The first part of a recurrence is the pattern. This specifies how often the event repeats. For example, an event could repeat "every 3 days," "every Thursday," or "on July 22 every year." A pattern is represented in the API by the [recurrencePattern resource](xref:graph.recurrencepattern).
    Depending on the type of pattern, certain fields of the **recurrencePattern** are required, optional, or ignored.
    
    Let's take a look at each of the possible pattern types.
