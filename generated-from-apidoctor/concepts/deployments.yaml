  heading: National cloud deployments
  intro: |
    In addition to our global network of datacenters, Microsoft cloud services are available in three separate national clouds. These national cloud versions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Microsoft enterprise cloud services, which are confined within the geographic borders of specific countries and operated by local personnel. To learn more, see [Microsoft National Clouds](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/NationalCloud).
    Current national clouds include:
    
    * Microsoft Cloud for US Government
    * Microsoft Cloud Germany
    * Azure and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China
    
    This article provides information about the different national cloud deployments of Microsoft Graph and the capabilities within each deployment that are available to developers.
