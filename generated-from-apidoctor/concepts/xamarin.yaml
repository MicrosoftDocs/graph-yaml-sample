  heading: Get started with Microsoft Graph in a Xamarin Forms app
  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the [Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/converged_auth) and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through the code inside the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for Xamarin Forms](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/xamarin-csharp-connect-sample) sample to explain the main concepts that you have to implement in an app that uses Microsoft Graph. The article also describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using the [Microsoft Graph Client Library](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/).
    This is the app you'll create.
