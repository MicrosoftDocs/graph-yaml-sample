  heading: Get started with Microsoft Graph in an AngularJS app
  intro: |
    This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through building the [Microsoft Connect Sample for AngularJS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/angular-connect-rest-sample) and explains the main concepts that you implement to use Microsoft Graph. The article also describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using either the [Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) or raw REST calls.
    The following image shows the app you'll create.

    ## Register the application
    Register an app on the Microsoft App Registration Portal. This generates the app ID and password that you'll use to configure the app in Visual Studio.
    
    1. Sign into the [Microsoft App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using either your personal or work or school account.
    1. Choose **Add an app**.
    1. Enter a name for the app, and choose **Create application**. 
    1. The registration page displays, listing the properties of your app.
    1. Copy the application ID. This is the unique identifier for your app that you'll use to configure the app.
    1. Under **Platforms**, choose **Add Platform** > **Web**.
    1. Make sure the **Allow Implicit Flow** check box is selected, and enter *http://localhost:8080* as the Redirect URI. 
    1. Choose **Save**.
