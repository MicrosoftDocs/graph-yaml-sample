  heading: Create and send Outlook messages
  intro: |
    Emails are represented by the [message](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/message.md) resource in Microsoft Graph.
    By default, messages are identified by a unique entry ID in the **id** property. A store provider assigns a message an entry ID when the message is initially
    saved as a draft or sent. That ID changes when the message is copied or moved to another folder, store, or .PST file.

    ## Creating and sending mail
    In Outlook, you can create and send an email in the same [sendMail](../api-reference/v1.0/api/user_sendmail.md) action, or you can [create](../api-reference/v1.0/api/user_post_messages.md) a draft, subsequently [add content](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_update.md) and [send](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_send.md) the draft.
    Similarly, when responding to an email, you can create and send the response in the same action ([reply](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_reply.md), [reply-all](../api-reference/v1.0/api//message_replyall.md), or [forward](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_forward.md)). Or, you can create a draft for the response ([reply](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_createreply.md), [reply-all](../api-reference/v1.0/api//message_createreplyall.md), or [forward](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_createforward.md)), [add content](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_update.md), and then [send](../api-reference/v1.0/api/message_send.md) the draft at a later time.
    To distinguish between a draft and a sent message programmatically, check the **isDraft** property.
    By default, draft messages are saved in the `Drafts` folder, sent messages are saved in the `Sent Items` folder. For convenience, you can identify the Drafts folder and SentItems folder by their corresponding [well-known folder names](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/mailfolder.md). For example, you can do the following to [get the messages](../api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list_messages.md) in the Drafts folder:
    GET /me/mailfolders('Drafts')
