    ## Note tag attributes
    In the HTML of a OneNote page, a note tag is represented by the `data-tag` attribute. For example:
    
    * An unchecked to-do box:  `<p data-tag="to-do">` 
    * A checked to-do box:  `<p data-tag="to-do:completed">` 
    * A star:  `<h2 data-tag="important">` 
    
    A `data-tag` value is composed of a shape, and sometimes a status (see all [supported values](#built-in-note-tags-for-onenote)).
    |Property|Description|
    |:-|:-|  -
    |shape|The identifier of the note tag (example: `to-do` or `important`).|
    |status|The status of check box note tags. This is used only to set check boxes as completed.|
