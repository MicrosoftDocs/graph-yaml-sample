  heading: "Microsoft Graph REST API v1.0 reference"
  intro: |
    Welcome to Microsoft Graph REST API reference for the v1.0 endpoint.
    API sets on the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`) are in general availability (GA) status, and have gone through a rigorous review-and-feedback process with customers to meet practical, production needs. Updates to APIs on this endpoint are additive in nature and do not break existing app scenarios.

    ## Common use cases
    The power of Microsoft Graph lies in easy navigation of entities and relationships across different services exposed on a single Microsoft Graph REST endpoint.
    A number of these services are designed to enable rich scenarios around a [user](xref:graph.user) and around a [group](xref:graph.group).
