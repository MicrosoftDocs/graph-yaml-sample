  heading: Build cross-device apps powered by Project Rome
  intro: |
    You can use Project Rome to build experiences that cross devices and platforms seamlessly, reducing friction for users and helping to drive app engagement. For applications to share data across devices and platforms using Project Rome APIs, you need to configure a cross-device app that includes information about your platform-specific apps. 
    A cross-device app enables you to: 
    
    * Use the Project Rome activity feed API in Microsoft Graph.  
    * Read and  write user activities published by a group of platform-specific applications by using the Project Rome SDK for Windows, Android, and/or iOS.
    * Target apps via the device relay capabilities in Project Rome by using the Project Rome SDK for Android or iOS.
    
    **Pick up where you left off across devices with the activity feed API**
    You can configure a cross-device app to associate your apps for Windows, iOS, Android, and the web so that the app on each platform can read and write user activities that are published by any app in the group. 
    For example, a user is finishing up a press release on her PC at work before dinner with friends. At the restaurant, she gets a notification from her boss about a typo that needs to be fixed asap. She opens the app on her Android phone and sees a card showing the press release she was editing earlier. She taps the card to open it so she can fix the release immediately and get back to her friends. 
    With this cross-device app configuration in place, the user's activity feed is synchronized across devices and platforms effortlessly so you can build experiences that help users pick up important tasks where they left off from any app surface. 
    **Choose the right screen at the right time with the device relay API**
    You can configure a cross-device app with push notification credentials for each of the platforms your app is available on so that a command or notification can be delivered to you on any device where you use the app, regardless of platform. 
    For example, a user is watching a video on the bus ride home from work. When she arrives home, she taps the app to launch the video on her Xbox One so she can continue watching on the big screen. 
    When you associate push notification credentials for each of the platforms where your app is available with your cross-device app, the user's app can send commands across devices, so you can build experiences that cross multiple screens or transition a workflow from one device to another in real time.

    ## Select the right hosting method for your cross-device app configuration
    You can host your cross-device app configuration either as a JSON file on your domain or as a profile configurable via the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). Choose a hosting option based on the Project Rome capabilities you want to enable in your apps.
