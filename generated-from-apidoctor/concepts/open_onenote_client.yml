  heading: "Open the OneNote client"
  intro: |
    You can use the **links** property of a page or notebook to open a OneNote application to a particular page or notebook. 
    The **links** property is a JSON object that contains two URLs. The URLs will open the page or notebook in the OneNote client application or in OneNote Online.
    { 
        "links": {
            "oneNoteClientUrl": {
                "href": "onenote:https://..."
            },
            "oneNoteWebUrl": {
                "href": "https://..."
            }
        }
    }

    
    * **oneNoteClientUrl** 
        * Opens the OneNote client if it is already installed on the device. This URL includes the *onenote* prefix.
        * Opens the language-specific version if one is installed on the device. Otherwise, uses the platform language setting.
    * **oneNoteWebUrl** 
        * Opens OneNote Online if the default browser on the device supports it. 
        * Uses the browser language setting.
    
    The OneNote API returns the **links** property in the HTTP response for the following operations:
    
    * Create a page by sending a [`POST pages`](xref:graph.section_post_pages) request.
    * Create a notebook by sending a [`POST notebooks`](xref:graph.onenote_post_notebooks) request.
    * Get page metadata by sending a [`GET pages`](xref:graph.page_get) or [`GET pages/{id}`](xref:graph.page_get) request.
    * Get notebook metadata by sending a [`GET notebooks`](xref:graph.notebook_get) or [`GET notebooks/{id}`](xref:graph.notebook_get) request.
    
    The following examples show how to check the status code of the response, parse the JSON to extract the URLs, and then open the OneNote client.
