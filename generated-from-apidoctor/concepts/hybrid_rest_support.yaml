  heading: Use REST APIs to access mailboxes in Exchange hybrid deployments (preview)
  intro: |
    Microsoft Graph has always provided access to customer mailboxes in the cloud on Exchange Online as part of Office 365.
    Exchange 2016 Cumulative Update 3 (CU3), released in September 2016 for Exchange on-premises servers, adds support for 
    REST API integration with Office 365. If your app uses v1.0 of the 
    [Mail](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/message), 
    [Calendar](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/calendar), or 
    [Contacts](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/contact) API, you will now also find a seamless 
    authentication and application experience in _hybrid_ deployments, regardless of whether the mailbox 
    is on-premises or in the cloud, provided that the deployment meets specific [requirements](#requirements-for-the-rest-api-to-work-in-hybrid-deployments). 
    Behind the scenes, when Microsoft Graph identifies that a REST API call is attempting to access an on-premises 
    mailbox in a hybrid deployment, it proxies the REST request to an on-premises REST endpoint which then processes
    the request. This discovery makes accessing the REST API possible.

    ## Requirements for the REST API to work in hybrid deployments
    Microsoft Graph provides openness (open standards support like JSON, OAUTH and ODATA, connecting from most popular platforms)
    and flexibility (granular, tightly scoped permissions to access user data). 
    If your organization is interested in enabling Microsoft Graph app development and is currently in or considering a hybrid deployment, 
    be aware of the following deployment requirements:
    
    * Mailbox requirements
        * All on-premises mailboxes that will use the REST APIs must be located on databases located on Exchange 2016 CU3 servers.Â 
    * Infrastructure requirements
        * All Exchange 2016 servers must be upgraded to CU3 or later.  
        * On-premises Active Directory must synchronize with Azure Active Directory.
        * Any Exchange 2013 servers coexisting in the same load-balanced array with Exchange 2016 servers must be removed from the array.
    * Networking requirements
        * From a DNS perspective, the Autodiscover namespace and on-premises client namespace must have Internet DNS records. 
        * If you have a firewall or application gateway that inspects and restricts access, update the appropriate settings to allow discovery and access.
