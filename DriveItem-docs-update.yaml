uid: graph.driveitem
name: DriveItem resource type
source_url: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/blob/master/api-reference/v1.0/resources/driveitem.md
summary: |
    The **driveItem** resource represents a file, folder, or other item stored in a drive.
    All file system objects in OneDrive and SharePoint are returned as **driveItem** resources.
    There are two primary ways of addressing a **driveItem** resource:
    
    * By the **driveItem** unique identifier using `drive/items/{item-id}`
    * By file system path using `/drive/root:/path/to/file`
    
    **DriveItem** resources have facets modeled as properties that provide data about the driveItem's identities and capabilities.
    For example:
    
    * Folders have a [**folder facet**][folder]
    * Files have a [**file facet**][file].
    * Images have an [**image facet**][image] in addition to their file facet.
    * Images taken with a camera (photos) have a [**photo facet**][photo] that identifies the item as a photo and provides the properties of when the photo was taken and with what device.
    
    Items with the **folder** facet act as containers of items and therefore have a `children` reference pointing to a collection of **driveItems** under the folder.
JSON representation:
  intro: |
    Here is a JSON representation of a **driveItem** resource.
    The **driveItem** resource is derived from [**baseItem**][baseItem] and inherits properties from that resource.
